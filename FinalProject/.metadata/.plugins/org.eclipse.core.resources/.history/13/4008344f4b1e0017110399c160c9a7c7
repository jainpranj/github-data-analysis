"ACQ Upload import-copy option With the addition of the new Vandelay features in ACQ, the ""Load bibs and Items"" option was replaced with Vandeley import options. In the context of ACQ, however, Vandelay is only concerned with importing bibs and not copies. Subsequently, the user lost the ability to both create catalog records and catalog copies in one step during ACQ upload. The patch remedies that by providing a new ""Load Items for Imported Records"" option within the upload page. When enabled, all successfully loaded ACQ copies will also be imported as real/catalog copies. Note that it's only added to the upload page, because all other ACQ interfaces assume that both bibs and copies should be created (e.g. during PO activation).

"auth.py: Added some logic to BaseAuthHandler.user_login() to responsibly deal with the situation where the user's session file is corrupt/empty. gateone.js: Added support for loading plugin CSS templates over the WebSocket. This will result in a large reduction in the number of GET requests. gateone.js: Tweaked the dimensions detection again... This time it is a bit more conservative. I'd rather have the top line be missing than have the top line get cut off. gateone.js: Added a new function to GateOne.Visual: widget(). It is very similar to GateOne.Visual.dialog() in that it creates a draggable element on the page with a specified title and content but with different styling. For example, the title isn't visible unless you hover the mouse over the widget for one second. Also, the entire widget is draggable (dialogs can only be moved by dragging the titlebar). Widgets can also have a configuration function assigned to them to provide the user with a configuration interface (an example of this is forthcoming). gateone.js: The single 'pastearea' is gone. It has been replaced with multiple paste areas! From now on each terminal will get their own. This is to enable things (like widgets) to be attached to terminals while being able to float above the paste area (from a z-index perspective). This is a fairly significant code change so there might be a few bugs that need to be ironed out. gateone.js: Fixed the long-standing bug where if you tried to drag a dialog in Firefox it would mysteriously get moved to the far left of the window (after which it would drag just fine). Now dialogs drag in a natural fashion. gateone.js: Fixed a long-standing bug with GateOne.Input.mouse() where it wasn't detecting/assigning Firefox scroll wheel events properly. gateone.py: Added support for sending plugin CSS templates via the TerminalWebSocket.get_style() function. gateone.py: Plugin CSS templates won't be called/loaded at the end of TerminalWebSocket.authenticate() anymore as gateone.js now takes care of that. SSH Plugin: execRemoteCmd() now supports an errorback function as a fourth argument that will get called in the event that the remote command exeution isn't successful. SSH Plugin: got_error() now accepts 'term' as a keyword argument (so that information can be available to the new errorback functionality). Themes: Tweaked them all in various ways and added the widget CSS. Nothing spectacular. Playback Plugin: Shift+scroll now works to go forwards/backwards in the playback history in Firefox. Previously this only worked in Chrome.",Python
