"vold: Allow pre-configured device pairs to switch mountpoints The use-case for this are devices with internal extended storage (pseudo-SDCard emmc) and an actual microSD card reader.

This allows us to specify a pair of mountpoints which can be switched from a user preference. For this vold.fstab: ----- dev_mount sdcard /mnt/sdcard ...<path-to-microSD-sysfs> dev_mount emmc /mnt/emmc ...<path-to-emmc-partition> ----- We can add to build.prop: ""ro.vold.switchablepair=/mnt/sdcard,/mnt/emmc"" A persistent toggle (persist.sys.vold.switchexternal), controllable through CMParts, can be presented to the user to allow choosing something other than our default as primary storage.

"Add zio constructor/destructor Add a standard zio constructor and destructor. Normally, this is done to reduce to cost of allocating a new structure by reducing expensive operations such as memory allocations. However, in this case none of the operations moved out of zio_create() were really very expensive. This change was principly made as a debug patch (and workaround) for a zio_destroy() race. The is good evidence that zio_create() is reinitializing a mutex which is really still in use by another thread. This would completely explain the observed symptoms in the issue report. This patch doesn't fix the root cause of the race, but it should make it less likely by only initializing the mutex once in the constructor. Also, this particular flaw might have gone unnoticed in other zfs implementations due to the specific implementation details of Linux ticket spinlocks. Once the real root cause is determined and resolved this change can be safely reverted. Until then this should help workaround the issue.

"What is different from current official build 0.8.1: Files Page: -double click on phone file (both panes) opens file in PC with the associated program for that extension with option to edit the file and save it back to phone; -added ""Properties"" in phone files/folders right click context menu with permissions changing capabilities; -switching left pane between PC/phone files now remembers last folder view for both; -left paths combo box now works for phone files too when switching left pane to phone files; -some bugs fixes; Apps Page: -major speedup displaying apps after the initial first run when apps info is collected; -fixed all functions, now all buttons and actions works as they should; -now you can backup and restore apps and data to any folder on /sdcard or PC, set backup folder location in Settings first; -option added to Backups context menu to add app/data if missing from existing previous backup; Recovery Page replaced with new Advanced Menu Page that works with CWM Recovery. What can be done: -run fix_permissions in Android OS mode, not in recovery mode. As you may know fix_permissions in CWM recovery is broken; -Fix/Undo Fix Market Cache Download; -Flash new Recovery; -Mount/Unmount any partition in recovery mode, Remount /system with read-write/read-only access in Android OS mode; -Repartitioning SD Card with /sd-ext partition (your choice of size and type) with option to backup /sdcard content before, and restoring it after the operation; -Wipe data/factory reset, cache, dalvik-cache, battery stats (your choice) in recovery mode; -Install zip of your choice from /sdcard; -Backup ROM to any folder on /sdcard or to default CWM location with option for Backup md5 sum validation after phone reboots back to Android OS, ensures proper backup is done; -Restore nandroid Backup with option to choose which partitions to restore(select all for full restore) and preliminary md5 sum validation for double safety; -One click Update ROM function which wipes cache and dalvik-cache before flashing. If Link2SD is detected on your phone you have an option to automatically copy its sd-ext mount script from current ROM to the new updated ROM saving you one reboot. Link2SD will not even know you updated the ROM; -One click ROM Flash with full wipe and options to install zips before/after(or both) the flash - this procedure reboots phone to Recovery, wipes dalvik-cache, formats /boot, /system, /data and /cache partitions, installs zip before(if selected), installs the new ROM, installs zip after(if selected) and reboots back to Android OS. Detailed information in Status Window is displayed for all operations taking place in real time. After phone reboots back to Android OS, the last CWM recovery log is displayed so you can spot any errors occurred during the last operation. -Shell Page is replaced with Command Prompt ""adb shell"" window; -And probably something else I forgot about; All bugs fixed(I believe). I want to thank and give credits to the guys (couldn't find their names) created some of the tools I'm using to make the new features works.",C++

"common/image.c: align usage of fdt_high with initrd_high The commit message of a28afca (Add uboot ""fdt_high"" enviroment variable) states that fdt_high behaves similarly to the existing initrd_high. But fdt_high actually has an outstanding difference from initrd_high. The former specifies the start address, while the later specifies the end address. As fdt_high and initrd_high will likely be used together, it'd be nice to have them behave same. The patch changes the behavior of fdt_high to have it aligned with initrd_high. The document of fdt_high in README is updated with an example to demonstrate the usage of this environment variable.

Accept the script if it's present and readable in $DOCBOOKSTYLE/bin, and otherwise search the PATH as before. Having fixed that up, we don't need the fallback case that was in the docs Makefile, and instead can throw an understandable error if configure didn't find the script.

"Handle spurious page faults that may occur in no-fault sections of the kernel. When access restrictions are added to a page table entry, we flush the corresponding virtual address mapping from the TLB. In contrast, when access restrictions are removed from a page table entry, we do not flush the virtual address mapping from the TLB. This is exactly as recommended in AMD's documentation. In effect, when access restrictions are removed from a page table entry, AMD's MMUs will transparently refresh a stale TLB entry. In short, this saves us from having to perform potentially costly TLB flushes. In contrast, Intel's MMUs are allowed to generate a spurious page fault based upon the stale TLB entry. Usually, such spurious page faults are handled by vm_fault() without incident. However, when we are executing no-fault sections of the kernel, we are not allowed to execute vm_fault(). This change introduces special-case handling for spurious page faults that occur in no-fault sections of the kernel.

"Merge branch 'next' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/benh/powerpc Pull powerpc merge from Benjamin Herrenschmidt: ""Here's the powerpc batch for this merge window. It is going to be a bit more nasty than usual as in touching things outside of arch/powerpc mostly due to the big iSeriesectomy :-) We finally got rid of the bugger (legacy iSeries support) which was a PITA to maintain and that nobody really used anymore. Here are some of the highlights: - Legacy iSeries is gone. Thanks Stephen ! There's still some bits and pieces remaining if you do a grep -ir series arch/powerpc but they are harmless and will be removed in the next few weeks hopefully. - The 'fadump' functionality (Firmware Assisted Dump) replaces the previous (equivalent) ""pHyp assisted dump""... it's a rewrite of a mechanism to get the hypervisor to do crash dumps on pSeries, the new implementation hopefully being much more reliable. Thanks Mahesh Salgaonkar. - The ""EEH"" code (pSeries PCI error handling & recovery) got a big spring cleaning, motivated by the need to be able to implement a new backend for it on top of some new different type of firwmare. The work isn't complete yet, but a good chunk of the cleanups is there. Note that this adds a field to struct device_node which is not very nice and which Grant objects to. I will have a patch soon that moves that to a powerpc private data structure (hopefully before rc1) and we'll improve things further later on (hopefully getting rid of the need for that pointer completely). Thanks Gavin Shan. - I dug into our exception & interrupt handling code to improve the way we do lazy interrupt handling (and make it work properly with ""edge"" triggered interrupt sources), and while at it found & fixed a wagon of issues in those areas, including adding support for page fault retry & fatal signals on page faults. - Your usual random batch of small fixes & updates, including a bunch of new embedded boards, both Freescale and APM based ones, etc...""

"Relax the FileCheck assertions in this test a touch. Previously the test relied on an artifact of how the inliner and subsequent passes in clang's -O3 mode happen to treat basic blocks and the labels for the basic blocks. In my work on the inliner, and changed this fundamental assumption, and the label that was being checked on the entry basic block will no longer appear in opt builds. There was no reason to expect the label to always be present anyways, much to my regret. I've changed the test to just ensure that we return an immediate constant. If there are intervening instructions, that's bad, but not really that relevant to the test.

"Merge pull request #31 from agnoster/keymaster --- Removes all handlers associated with a given scope, allowing throw-away and re-usable scopes. Includes test. Adds 1 function, 8 lines of functional code, and 117 bytes to the minified version. I took the liberty of adding a simple test for scope while I was at it. I love how keymaster is so simple and small, I hope this addition does not constitute undue bloat. If youre curious why I added this function: on a single-site app Im building we want to be able to be able to switch to different ""apps"" with their own shortcuts. However, when we navigate away from the app it is destroyed, and a new one is created when we navigate back. Allowing us to destroy the scope of all shortcuts the app registered means we dont need to worry about callbacks to a dead app being fired (and of course the app not getting garbage-collected because the closures hold references to it). Of course, if theres another, better way to do this, Id be happy to hear that too. Now, we can just do: // on app open key(n, this.appName, this.createNewItem); // ... and other shortcuts... key.setScope(this.appName); // on app close key.setScope(all); key.deleteScope(this.appName); Conflicts: keymaster.js keymaster.min.js",JavaScript

"Fix occasional unwanted display rotations. A number of people were complaining about display rotations when holding the phone perfectly upwards and speaker activity, such as a ringtone playing or a YouTube video playing. Fix that by - Adding only one accelerometer to the sensor list. Previously, both the AK8973 and the KXTF9 accelerometer were advertised to the sensor service. Only the KXTF9 was actually used, but the AK8973 one was listed first, so the service picked up this one. This led to a mismatch of sensor values and advertised value range. - Dropping the KXTF9 orientation sensor code. Due to limited precision and the fact that the KXTF9 orientation sensor is 2-axis only, we weren't using the sensor anyway (at least we didn't advertise it). Nevertheless, the kernel driver sent events, which we handled and pushed to the service. While doing so, we shared the event structure, which (at least could) lead to wrong data being sent to the service (e.g. accelerometer precision was always sent as UNRELIABLE = 0). Stop doing that and handle only the accelerometer in the KXTF9 driver. Change-Id: I3b3f1955c855ab1a81785767ce616d33713de341",C

While doing so, we shared the event structure, which (at least could) lead to wrong data being sent to the service (e.g. accelerometer precision was always sent as UNRELIABLE = 0). Stop doing that and handle only the accelerometer in the KXTF9 driver. Change-Id: I3b3f1955c855ab1a81785767ce616d33713de341",C

"[release-v1.6.1] Added pagination to the 'current_package_list_with_resources' action. Using this action to retrieve the whole list of datasets in even a moderately-sized catalogue is extremely slow. (In the order of 5-6 datasets/sec on my development machine). Aside from this being slow, this means that since one of our supported deployments is proxying through nginx, nginx will timeout the request before it is completed. So as a worksround for now, the datasets can be paginated through multiple smaller requests. Meaning at least the connection won't timeout; even if the total time retrieving the datasets is approximately the same.",Python

"Embryonic support for op_iteration_space Recognise op_iteration_space constructs in parallel loops and correctly populate sub-iteration-space extents in op_arg_mat calls that match with them. The magic symbol op_i(n) in the index position of an op_arg_mat means that the upper extent of the loop over map dimensions should be taken from the nth argument of the op_iteration_space construct, the lower extent is always taken to be 0. So for example: op_par_loop(..., op_iteration_space(set, 3, 4), op_arg_mat(mat, op_i(1), map, op_i(2), map, ...)) produces code where as well as an iteration over the elements of the set, the kernel is executed with extra arguments i and j where i runs from 0 to 2 and j from 0 to 3.",C++

"Use a different memory allocator for message data Before this, perl's memory allocator was used via Newxz and Safefree. That's fine as long as these functions are only ever called from within a thread with the right interpreter context set and as long as only one thread is ever accessing the allocator at any given time. However, with zmq destroying message data asynchronously in a thread other than perl's main thread, it was possible for perl itself trying to allocate, reallocate, or free memory using its builtin allocator while a thread created my zmq was trying to free data through perl's memory allocator. That caused havoc. What needs to be done is avoiding perl's allocator from being used concurrently by multiple threads. One way to do that would be a mutex, but it felt somewhat silly to introduce possible contention for something that's only used to free chunks of memory after they're not needed anymore in the background. An alternative solution, as implemented by this patch, is to stop the background free thread from using perl's allocator at all. It now uses the local libc's free. Memory is still allocated from a different thread, so there might still be concurrent access to libc's allocator. However, all modern libc allocators I've seen are thread safe, at least if they're being linked against a threading library, such as pthread. If, for whatever reason, your libc's malloc isn't thread safe, the problem this patch intends to fix will still exist, but it will be no worse than before using perl's malloc.",Perl

I never got a reasonable testcase out of it, and anything I do get is likely to be quite fragile due to requiring an interaction of two different passes, and the only result being a segfault if it goes wrong. git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/llvm/trunk@153176 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8",C++

"userportal: Improve login process This patch improves the common login infrastructure (BaseApplicationInit) and implements UserPortal-specific logic that gets executed after successful login (calling UserPortalLoginModel.UpdateIsENGINEUser method, and updating UI according to ""IsENGINEUser"" property value). Summary of changes: 1. Refactored BaseApplicationInit login-related methods. Added login model type parameter to BaseApplicationInit. 2. UserPortal ApplicationInit: instead of performing the actual UI login operation immediately after UserPortalLoginModel fires its LoggedInEvent, we call UserPortalLoginModel.UpdateIsENGINEUser method to determine user type. After we receive user type information (async callback), we store it into CurrentUserRole, which is a singleton object used to hold user role information. Then we proceed with the actual login operation. CurrentUserRole impacts the default place of the ""main"" section: - for user with isEngineUser==true, default ""main"" place is ""Basic"" main tab - for user with isEngineUser==false, default ""main"" place is ""Extended"" main tab CurrentUserRole also impacts ""main"" section UI: - for user with isEngineUser==true, the main tab panel is hidden (user has only access to ""Basic"" main tab content) - for user with isEngineUser==false, the main tab panel is visible (user has access to both ""Basic"" and ""Extended"" main tab content) This is a direct analogy to how original UserPortal handles user login and adapts UI according to ""isEngineUser"" user role information. 3. UserPortal now has its own specific place manager. This is required because UserPortal has two different default ""main"" section places, depending on the current user role. After the user logs in, place manager ensures that he is properly redirected to appropriate default ""main"" section place. 4. Created LoggedInExtendedPlaceGatekeeper that protects ""main"" section places within the ""Extended"" main tab. Gatekeeper strategy in UserPortal is following: - LoggedInExtendedPlaceGatekeeper is the default gatekeeper - LoginSectionPresenter (#login) uses @NoGatekeeper as usual - MainTabBasicPresenter (#basic) uses @UseGatekeeper with standard LoggedInGatekeeper This properly protects ""Extended"" main tab places from being accessed by unauthorized users (users with isEngineUser==false), even if they manipulate application URL.
