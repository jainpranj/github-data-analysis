"Add visibility into transfers/handoff Purpose ---------- Visibility into handoff is really poor. The typical method used to discover handoff information is `riak-admin transfers` but that gives hardly any useful information, as shown below. 'dev3@127.0.0.1' waiting to handoff 7 partitions 'dev2@127.0.0.1' waiting to handoff 4 partitions 'dev1@127.0.0.1' waiting to handoff 5 partitions This PR adds visibility transfers/handoff by tracking various stats on active transfers and displaying this information in a human friendly way, as shown below. ./dev/dev1/bin/riak-admin transfers 'dev3@127.0.0.1' waiting to handoff 6 partitions 'dev2@127.0.0.1' waiting to handoff 4 partitions 'dev1@127.0.0.1' waiting to handoff 6 partitions Active Transfers: transfer type: ownership_handoff vnode type: riak_kv_vnode partition: 365375409332725729550921208179070754913983135744 started: 2012-04-24 18:43:44 [5.96 s ago] last update: 2012-04-24 18:43:48 [1.91 s ago] objects transferred: 8651 2135 Objs/s dev3@127.0.0.1 =======================> dev1@127.0.0.1 17.62 MB/s This PR also gets rid of the annoying side effect of resetting the inactivity timeout when calling `riak-admin transfers`. This would often cause users to wonder why handoffs were never occurring. Implementation Details ---------- One issue with handoff is that it uses vnode folds to do all it's work. This has the one nice benefit that it avoids a local copy of data (1) but has bad side effect of using uninterruptable fold. That is, the vnode fold does the work as fast as it can and doesn't stop until it's done (2). In order to get status updates about the handoff the accumulator keeps some local stats and _approximately_ every 2 seconds sends those stats to the handoff manager via the `status_update/2` API. I say the timing is approximate because expiration of the interval is only checked during a sender/receiver sync phase (determined by `ACK_COUNT`). If the receiver can't keep up or the sender fold is slow then the status updates could take longer. Essentially, this code assumes that `ACK_COUNT` objects can be transferred in less than 2s. **N.B.** The duration of the status update interval will not invalidate the stats since they are based on start time and time of last sync (see `riak_core_handoff_manager:update_stats/2`). The reason the sender only sends a status update every 2s and only checks if this interval has expired on sender/receiver sync is because the vnode fold is a tight loop. Sending an update for every object would be too chatty and checking the interval every object could potentially slow from overhead of getting time and doing math. There are two types of transfer currently, _ownership handoff_ and _hinted handoff_. Soon there will be another type, _repair_. In order to disambiguate the two types of handoff I have to determine if the source vnode is primary or not. In the case of ownership handoff it is a `primary -> secondary` handoff (where the secondary becomes primary after handoff completes) and for hinted handoff it's `secondary -> primary`. In order to make the stats a little easier to read I added a little human friendly formatting. I decided to put the code to support this in Core rather than KV. I stole and modified the code from @seancribbs. One aspect of this PR I'm not wild about is the fact that in order to get the status a msg must be sent to each handoff manager on each each node for every time `riak-admin transfers` is called (3). I'd rather see a push system where all active status data is collated at a particular node, like the claimant node in ownership, and the status call simply reads that. The pull system is probably fine for now but could cause trouble on larger clusters, especially if some script accidentally calls it in a tight loop. I'm wondering if I should have make use of the stats API for the collection of data in the handoff manager rather than a dict? Footnotes ---------- 1: That is, if the handoff sender process itself was running the handoff then the vnode data would have to be copied from vnode heap to sender heap. 2: In the future I think an iterator/cursor based approach to handoff that is async, interruptable, and rate limited would be good. 3: Which calls `riak_core_status:all_active_transfers` where the RPC is done.",Erlang

"- I've realised that I THOUGHT I was running ConTest in previous tests. Indeed I was but I hadn't specified in a 'KingProperties' file the classes that should be instrumented by ConTest. * Therefore, I've added a KingProperties file which specifies the target classes to be those in the ex9 package and also the ReadSet, WriteSet and LockManager classes in the org.deuce.transaction.tl2twilight package * NOTE that with the trial version that I have there is a limit of 10 classes * The reason the Context class is not in KingProperties file is because it has several inner classes which are getting instrumented in the process and thus I hit the 10 class limit just by those inner classes! argh! I just want the Context class itself and not its inner classes to be instrumented. * In fact, I don't think quite all of WriteSet is being instrumented because it has four anonymous classes which are causing the class limit to be hit quicker. LockManager is getting instrumented okay. I think ReadSet is as well. * Note that you also need a special license file to run ConTest but I've not included that here. - Atomicity appears to be holding with ConTest instrumenting the ex9 package and the LockManager, ReadSet and part of WriteSet classes. Ideally, I would like to instrument Context class too to give me greater confidence in the correctness of the implementation.",Java

"Reflection and reification: Names and Symbols. - Consolidating many islands of name organization. Folds NameManglers into StdNames. Brings more of the string constants together with similar constants. Move name manipulation methods which produce TypeNames into object tpnme rather than nme. - Starting on MethodSymbolApi, ClassSymbolApi, etc so we can put sensible methods on sensible entities. This pushed into Definitions, where I pulled a whole bunch out of the api side (or at least marked my intention to do so -- too many tests use them to make them easy to remove) and on the compiler side, returned something more specific than Symbol a bunch of places. - Added a number of conveniences to Definitions to make it easier to get properly typed symbols. Note: one way in which you might notice having better typed Symbols is with Sets, which have the annoying property of inferring a type based on what they've been constructed with and then hard failing when you test for the presence of a more general type. So this: val mySet = Set(a, b) println(mySet(c)) ..goes from compiling to not compiling if a and b receive more specific types (e.g. they are MethodSymbols) and c is a Symbol or ClassSymbol or whatever. This is easily remedied on a site-by-site basis - create Set[Symbol](...) not Set(...) - but is an interesting and unfortunate consequence of type inference married to invariance. The changes to DummyMirror where things became ??? were driven by the need to lower its tax; type ""Nothing"" is a lot more forgiving about changes than is any specific symbol type.",Scala

"merged branch m0ppers/master (PR #611) Commits ------- 71449e8 Remove optimization (covered by Optimization VAR_ACCESS anyway) Discussion ---------- Remove optimization (covered by Optimization VAR_ACCESS anyway) I have an own template class implementing getContext() and this one drove me completely mad after a twig upgrade. After compilation the resulting templates have: isset($context['bla']) vs. $this->getContext('bla') Changing the Name Node however didn't have any effect and i saw that due to the optimizations by the SetTemp class twig doesn't even reach the Name Node. In fact SetTemp has the isset optimization hardcoded (which is ok). I could simply fix my issue by setting optimizations to -9 (all optimizations except VAR_ACCESS). However the issue will reappear immediately when using PHP 5.4. Please remove the isset stuff from the non optimized node and let the optimization handler handle it (which i would disable in my case) --------------------------------------------------------------------------- by m0ppers at 2012-01-24T17:42:07Z some hackish script to test what i mean <?php require 'lib/Twig/Autoloader.php'; Twig_Autoloader::register(); abstract class Harxtemplate extends Twig_Template { public function getContext($context, $item, $ignoreStrictCheck = false) { if ($item == ""hans"") { return ""hund""; } else { return parent::getContext($context, $item, $ignorStrictCheck); } } } $template = <<<EOT Der {{ hans }} hat hund {% if hans %} hund {% endif %} EOT; $loader = new Twig_Loader_String(); $options = array('base_template_class' => 'Harxtemplate', // 'strict_variables' => true, // doesn't work 'debug' => true, 'optimizations' => -1, // 0 => works ); $twig = new Twig_Environment($loader, $options); echo $twig->render($template);",PHP

"Use LIST instead of VALUES to get rid of annoying warning. See commit for explanation. In the current haskell-mode.el there is: (eval-when-compile ;; Emacs 21 defines `values' as a (run-time) alias for list. ;; Don't maerge this with the pervious clause. (if (string-match ""values"" (pp (byte-compile (lambda () (values t))))) (defsubst values (&rest values) values))) Which brings up an annoying buffer in Emacs 23.3.1 stating “Warning: Function `values' from cl package called at runtime”, the reason being that functions from the CL package are deprecated in some way at RMS's hand. At any rate, the use of VALUES is only for MULTIPLE-VALUE-BIND in one function, in one use in the whole file and project. In actuality, MULTIPLE-VALUE-BIND accepts a list as its input form, therefore we can use LIST rather than VALUES with it, and VALUES is redundant and we avoid this whole warning and mess. I've tested this only on Emacs 23.3.1, but I'm fairly confident that the behaviour of MULTIPLE-VALUE-BIND with lists is quite old and reliable. If there are any problems with it bugs should be reported and we can address, but otherwise this seems like a fine change.",Emacs Lisp
"Use 1000 iterations for the to-raw-and-back test. The to-raw-and-back test has a lot of ground to cover, since there are several different frame types. The default of 100 tests seems a little skimpy. After poking around for a bit, I've found how to change the default: using test-framework's 'plusTestOptions' function. The only oddity was figuring out how to use the TestOptions type; what was confusing and at first a little annoying is the lack of a set of default TestOptions. However, TestOptions is just a type synonym for TestOptions Maybe where each of the fields in TestOptions f is wrapped with an 'f'. Further, TestOptions = TestOptions' Maybe is an instance of Monoid, where 'mempty' is a TestOptions value with Nothing in every field. You can override the number of generated tests by using mempty { topt_maximum_generated_tests = Just 1000 } With this change, the to-raw-frame-and-back test now runs for 1000 iterations instead of the default 100. I've run the full set of tests for over 100 times without any failures.",Haskell

"Makefile: Change the default compiler from ""gcc"" to ""cc"" Ever since the very first commit to git.git we've been setting CC to ""gcc"". Presumably this is behavior that Linus copied from the Linux Makefile. However unlike Linux Git is written in ANSI C and supports a multitude of compilers, including Clang, Sun Studio, xlc etc. On my Linux box ""cc"" is a symlink to clang, and on a Solaris box I have access to ""cc"" is Sun Studio's CC. Both of these are perfectly capable of compiling Git, and it's annoying to have to specify CC=cc on the command-line when compiling Git when that's the default behavior of most other portable programs. So change the default to ""cc"". Users who want to compile with GCC can still add ""CC=gcc"" to the make(1) command-line, but those users who don't have GCC as their ""cc"" will see expected behavior, and as a bonus we'll be more likely to smoke out new compilation warnings from our distributors since they'll me using a more varied set of compilers by default.

"Zone offset formatting. I'm developing a far more substantiative offset lookup function for a subsequent commit. The updates to `convertToPOSIX` and `convertToWallclock` in this commit are stop along the way. They will do the right thing for a couple of key clock transitions in `America/Detroit`. This allows us to test the zone offset and timezone abbreviation formatting. Zone Offset Formatting ---------------------- I've implemented the `%z` and `%Z` format specifiers, including the precision specification using the colon `:`. Tests accompany the implementation. The zone entry and rule entry are now cached in the `request` context object for use in the zone offset formatting functions. For some reason I find it notable that the formatting functions now accept a 4th parameter, that only the `%z` implementation function uses. That is the string of matched colons for the `%z` specifier for the colon separated variants, e.g. `%::z`. Olson File to JSON Preprocessor - Savings Letters ------------------------------------------------- To simplify formatting the zone abbreviations, the Olson file to JSON preprocessor program has been updated to replace a rule entry's `letter` property value with with `""""` if it is `""-""`. This way we don't have to convert from `""-""` to `""""` in our formatting code. It is merely a shift of this conditional from the `tz` function into the Olson file to JSON preprocessor. Olson File to JSON Preprocessor - Modularization ------------------------------------------------ The Olson file to JSON preprocessor program now prepends the `module.exports` assignment before the JSON string. Not sure why it wasn't doing that before. Maybe I had a plan to load those files without using `require`. In fact, how do I imagine I'm going to load those files in the browser? They would be of no use to a browser as simple JSON, since they must load synchronously. I know I didn't leave this project in October of last year thinking that zones and locales were going to load through callbacks. I'll cross that bridge when I create the `gh-pages` demos. Premature cross-platform considerations are like premature optimization, at least in the case when something is known to be generally cross-platform. On premature optimization, I've always felt it better to say premature micro-optimization is the root of all evil, so that it maintains the spirit of the original quote, when taken out of context. > Programmers waste enormous amounts of time thinking about, or worrying about, > the speed of noncritical parts of their programs, and these attempts at > efficiency actually have a strong negative impact when debugging and > maintenance are considered. We should forget about small efficiencies, say > about 97% of the time: premature optimization is the root of all evil. Yet we > should not pass up our opportunities in that critical 3%. Snipped that quote from [c2.com](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PrematureOptimization). If you are going to find the longest common sequences in two series, you need a difference algorithm. It is not premature optimization to forgo a naive attempt at a difference using nested for loops. Similarly, I'm finding that if I write for Node.js first and only, but it just so happens that I have few dependencies, then it turns out that library was a browser-also library after all. (This probably could be better said in the log messages for [Strata](http://github.com/bigeasy/strata).) As a result of these updates to the JSON output files, I've updated all of the zone JSON files. All Timezones Module -------------------- For the Node.js require mechanism, I created an index that will load all timezone JSON files in the timezone directory and create a single export. Clock Transition Observations ----------------------------- Timezone offset calculation is going to be replaced shortly, but these are some notes on the current implementation. There are lots of interesting edges in the file. * The start of standard is always a to the second offset, based on the relation of the sun to a particular municipality. * There US Peace Time, a transition that is only an abbreviation transition, that is triggered by a UTC time. * Standard times have been discovered in the European files, so a time in the Olson files indicate clock transitions using either UTC, standard or wallclock time. * There is the implicit first rule before the first daylight savings time rule that has savings. It implies no savings. To be sure that I'm using the correct letter in the entry format, I search for an example of no savings, using a subsequent rule entry as a placeholder for the implicit one. Why We Never Parse Timezone Abbreviations ----------------------------------------- I'd considered what it meant to go the other way, to parse timezone offsets. The numeric offsets can and will be parsed. The timezone abbreviations cannot be parsed. Something that I'd considered in the past with the same conclusion. Something I'll consider in the future with the same conclusion. Recently, I rediscovered one of my favorite comments from the Olson files... > The UNIX Version 7 ""timezone"" function is not present in this package; it's > impossible to reliably map timezone's arguments (a ""minutes west of GMT"" value > and a ""daylight saving time in effect"" flag) to a time zone abbreviation, and > we refuse to guess. I'm sure I'll ponder whether I'm supposed to support this again at some point in the future, but in my notes for this commit, I have out of scope written in all caps. It seems that, when I think about it for a while, I'm angry at the notion of being responsible for such a thing. I'm succumbing to admonishment-oriented programming, where I imagine someone pestering me in a comment somewhere about a possible implementation. Parsing timezone abbreviations is natural language processing. We don't do that in this library. Tidy ---- Renamed the variable `epoch` to `posix` in `t/offset/dst`.",JavaScript

"Fixed tests failing on timezone abbreviations. Before my last commit, I did not run my tests. Tests failed. I blocked out some tests in `t/format/offset.t`. Some of these tests are new tests. They use Amsterdam as a timezone. I was under the impression from a combination of my reading any my faulty memory that Amsterdam had some strange, down to the second timezone offset that occurred after the adoption of standard time. Nope. Amsterdam did have surprised, though. Amsterdam does have clock transitions that occur at standard time. Plus, I encountered the issue of rule sets whose first entry begins after the time at which the rule set is applied, implying no daylight savings time rule in effect, or standard time. I'll revisit Amsterdam after the clock transition table is implemented. I fixed the tests in `t/math` that were defeated by the timezone abbreviation. Previously, the timezone abbreviation return was always `UTC`, because timezone abbreviations had not yet been implemented. Now the correct timezone abbreviations are being returned. It is the test that is the failure. I heap scorn upon it. In anticipation of future scorn heaping upon yours truly, let me confess that these tests that failed on the timezone abbreviation are only passing because I changed the expected output to match the actual output, without taking the time to reason about whether the actual output is correct. I'll let you hate for two minutes before I continue. Now, if you've recovered from that, let me explain. You see, I am working on a far more thorough test for timezone offsets. One where I take a list of every clock transition in the Olson files and compare the logic of my timezone library against the output of GNU date for the second of every the clock transition, and the second before every the clock transition. Rather than fuss about these tests, I'd rather spend my time working on this new test.",JavaScript

Fix from Eric Dumazet. 11) do_tcp_sendpage() unloads the send queue way too fast, because it invokes tcp_push() when it shouldn't. Let the natural sequence generated by the splice paths, and the assosciated MSG_MORE settings, guide the tcp_push() calls. Otherwise what goes out of TCP is spaghetti and doesn't batch effectively into GSO/TSO clusters. From Eric Dumazet. 12) Once we put a SKB into either the netlink receiver's queue or a socket error queue, it can be consumed and freed up, therefore we cannot touch it after queueing it like that. Fixes from Eric Dumazet. 13) PPP has this annoying behavior in that for every transmit call it immediately stops the TX queue, then calls down into the next layer to transmit the PPP frame. But if that next layer can take it immediately, it just un-stops the TX queue right before returning from the transmit method. Besides being useless work, it makes several facilities unusable, in particular things like the equalizers. Well behaved devices should only stop the TX queue when they really are full, and in PPP's case when it gets backlogged to the downstream device. David Woodhouse therefore fixed PPP to not stop the TX queue until it's downstream can't take data any more. 14) IFF_UNICAST_FLT got accidently lost in some recent stmmac driver changes, re-add.

"Replace empty locale name with implied value in CREATE DATABASE and initdb. setlocale() accepts locale name """" as meaning ""the locale specified by the process's environment variables"". Historically we've accepted that for Postgres' locale settings, too. However, it's fairly unsafe to store an empty string in a new database's pg_database.datcollate or datctype fields, because then the interpretation could vary across postmaster restarts, possibly resulting in index corruption and other unpleasantness. Instead, we should expand """" to whatever it means at the moment of calling CREATE DATABASE, which we can do by saving the value returned by setlocale(). For consistency, make initdb set up the initial lc_xxx parameter values the same way. initdb was already doing the right thing for empty locale names, but it did not replace non-empty names with setlocale results. On a platform where setlocale chooses to canonicalize the spellings of locale names, this would result in annoying inconsistency. (It seems that popular implementations of setlocale don't do such canonicalization, which is a pity, but the POSIX spec certainly allows it to be done.) The same risk of inconsistency leads me to not venture back-patching this, although it could certainly be seen as a longstanding bug. Per report from Jeff Davis, though this is not his proposed patch.",C

"Make mythuiwebbrowser and mythdownloadmanager share cookies Fixes #9802 Seems that Qt went out of their way to make QNetworkCookieJars difficult to work with. They are not threadsafe (as you can not move them from a QObject owner in one thread to a QObject owner in another, even if shared). They also disabled copying them. Argh. So... Since I already had subclassed it to MythCookieJar anyways, I added the copy functionality within the subclass. Unfortunately to use this, you need to use some unsavory static_casts on the pointers to force it to allow you to effectively copy from the master class to the subclass... and back... Yuk! So, to share the cookie jar as best we can, when a mythuiwebbrowser starts up, it takes a copy of the cookie jar that the mythdownloadmanager is holding. When the mythuiwebbrowser is torn down, it copies the cookie jar back into the mythdownloadmanager, which then will copy from that temporary jar into its actual cookie jar at a convenient time in its processing. The cookie jar in the mythdownloadmanager is protected by a mutex so that there should be no clobbering at the same time. However, since the MDM could have updated the jar while the browser was running, there is some possibility that any cookies the MDM accumulated during that time will be lost on refresh from the browser.",C

"kbuild: do not check for ancient modutils tools scripts/depmod.sh checks for the output of '-V' expecting that it has module-init-tools in it. It's a hack to prevent users from using modutils instead of module-init-tools, that only works with 2.4.x kernels. This however prints an annoying warning for kmod tool, that is currently replacing module-init-tools. Rather than putting another check for kmod's version, just remove it since users of 2.4.x kernel are unlikely to upgrade to 3.x, and if they do, let depmod fail in that case because they should know what they are doing.

"bash: fix ""getcwd: cannot access parent directories: Math result..."" In get_working_directory(), the getcwd call in the __ANDROID__ workaround case was obviously wrong, having sizeof(char *) as a length argument instead of the length of the malloced string itself. Also, no check for malloc failure was there. With this fix, tested on maguro, using bash with the usual prompt containing pwd references, as well as the pwd bash builtin itself, no longer spew these annoying messages mentioned in the title. Also made a small change to sh_invalidnum() to fix compile warnings. Change-Id: I9546e07731a251f80e410935619ddcf0873694af",C

"Delay sequence number allocation for A-MPDU until just before the frame is queued to the hardware. Because multiple concurrent paths can execute ath_start(), multiple concurrent paths can push frames into the software/hardware TX queue and since preemption/interrupting can occur, there's the possibility that a gap in time will occur between allocating the sequence number and queuing it to the hardware. Because of this, it's possible that a thread will have allocated a sequence number and then be preempted by another thread doing the same. If the second thread sneaks the frame into the BAW, the (earlier) sequence number of the first frame will be now outside the BAW and will result in the frame being constantly re-added to the tail of the queue. There it will live until the sequence numbers cycle around again. This also creates a hole in the RX BAW tracking which can also cause issues. This patch delays the sequence number allocation to occur only just before the frame is going to be added to the BAW. I've been wanting to do this anyway as part of a general code tidyup but I've not gotten around to it. This fixes the PR. However, it still makes it quite difficult to try and ensure in-order queuing and dequeuing of frames. Since multiple copies of ath_start() can be run at the same time (eg one TXing process thread, one TX completion task/one RX task) the driver may end up having frames dequeued and pushed into the hardware slightly/occasionally out of order. And, to make matters more annoying, net80211 may have the same behaviour - in the non-aggregation case, the TX code allocates sequence numbers before it's thrown to the driver. I'll open another PR to investigate this and potentially introduce some kind of final-pass TX serialisation before frames are thrown to the hardware. It's also very likely worthwhile adding some debugging code into ath(4) and net80211 to catch when/if this does occur. PR: kern/166190 git-svn-id: svn+ssh://svn.freebsd.org/base/head@233227 ccf9f872-aa2e-dd11-9fc8-001c23d0bc1f",C
