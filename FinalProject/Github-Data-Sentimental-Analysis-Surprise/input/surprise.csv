"Remove platform APIs which are not used by any code and which had only stub implementations or no implementation on all platforms. Some of these functions might be good ideas, but their semantics were unclear given the lack of implementation, and an unlucky porter could be fooled into trying to implement them or, worse, being baffled when something like platform_trap_enter() failed to be called. git-svn-id: svn+ssh://svn.freebsd.org/base/head@232853 ccf9f872-aa2e-dd11-9fc8-001c23d0bc1f",C

"A new quad shader courtesy of Markus Kivioja. Still behind glshader=quad. This shader uses a buffer full of unit quads, and passes all the necessary transforms in an array of 4x4 matrices (including the texture coordinates and screen size), and only passes one copy of the matrix per quad (instead of per vertex like the other shader). This results in less data being sent to GL, fewer GL calls, and allows WebGL to validate the element array once, instead of on every frame. If this isn't substantially faster than the indexed tris shader, I'll be surprised.",Java
"This build is not working; for some reason the if statement in the Click function in the menuLogic class returns that the buttonLocation property is not in the logicContainer. On debug, the debugger shows that at that point the logicContainer is actualy empty; After tracing, it turns out that the logicContainer magically becomes empty at that point and restores it's contents after that function has ended.

"PYTHON 3 SUPPORT HAS BEEN ADDED! All throughout the code things have been updated here and there in order to support Python 3. A few things might be a little rough around the edges and it *does* take a long time for the 2to3 tool to work its magic when you run ""python3 setup.py install"" but by golly it *works*! Not only does it work but it is FAST. Preliminary benchmarks show Gate One using markdely less memory and CPU running under Python 3.2 (I can't wait to try 3.3!) than it does with Python 2.7. I'll be tweaking things here and there in the next few commits (related to Python 3 support) and I wouldn't be surprised if I can make it perform even better. setup.py: Support for Python 3 ""just works"". Though it does take a lot longer to install if you run ""python3 setup.py install"" (since the whole /opt/gateone dir must be walked converting everything to work with Python 3). terminal.py: Updated the version string to 1.1. utils.py: Updated the version string to 1.1. utils.py: Modified human_readable_bytes() to use ""nbytes"" as the argument instead of ""bytes"" to avoid the use of a python built-in. utils.py: Using Tornado's utf8() and to_unicode() functions in a few places to make it easier to support both python2.6+ and python3+ simultaneously. Bookmarks Plugin: The use of html5lib has been changed to be a dynamic import (where it's used). I'm going to see if I can figure out a way to get importing/exporting bookmarks working without this module to make ""python3 setup.py install"" go faster (most of the time is spent converting html5lib!). SSH Plugin: ssh_connect.py: The get_identities() function now double-checks that identities exist before it returns them as a list. This means you won't see them when ssh_connect.py prints that ""The following identities will be used..."" message (which is good and logical). The next time the user marks an identity as default the .default_ids file will get cleaned up automatically.",Python

"Add a long comment about Solaris 11 BPF. I was surprised when I found that Solaris 11 scanning works now. I thought that it would require a change in the defines around pcap_selectable_fd_valid, because it's valid for Solaris 10 and earlier but not for Solaris 11. Why it started working was the pcap_selectable_fd_one_to_one test added in r28319. As a side effect of that function overrides pcap_selectable_fd_valid for all Solaris releases, it makes changes in pcap_selectable_fd_valid unnecessary. However it is indirect in the way it does it, so I'm adding a comment explaining the situation and a hope that there is an easy change to make pcap_selectable_fd_valid correct on its own.",C

"Fixed tests failing on timezone abbreviations. Before my last commit, I did not run my tests. Tests failed. I blocked out some tests in `t/format/offset.t`. Some of these tests are new tests. They use Amsterdam as a timezone. I was under the impression from a combination of my reading any my faulty memory that Amsterdam had some strange, down to the second timezone offset that occurred after the adoption of standard time. Nope. Amsterdam did have surprised, though. Amsterdam does have clock transitions that occur at standard time. Plus, I encountered the issue of rule sets whose first entry begins after the time at which the rule set is applied, implying no daylight savings time rule in effect, or standard time. I'll revisit Amsterdam after the clock transition table is implemented. I fixed the tests in `t/math` that were defeated by the timezone abbreviation. Previously, the timezone abbreviation return was always `UTC`, because timezone abbreviations had not yet been implemented. Now the correct timezone abbreviations are being returned. It is the test that is the failure. I heap scorn upon it. In anticipation of future scorn heaping upon yours truly, let me confess that these tests that failed on the timezone abbreviation are only passing because I changed the expected output to match the actual output, without taking the time to reason about whether the actual output is correct. I'll let you hate for two minutes before I continue. Now, if you've recovered from that, let me explain. You see, I am working on a far more thorough test for timezone offsets. One where I take a list of every clock transition in the Olson files and compare the logic of my timezone library against the output of GNU date for the second of every the clock transition, and the second before every the clock transition. Rather than fuss about these tests, I'd rather spend my time working on this new test.",JavaScript

"Changed Math.Round() calls to use the appropriate overload so the mid point will always round away from zero. It is unfortunate that Microsoft decided to make the default rounding scheme use ""To Even"", otherwise called ""banker's rounding"". This rounding method works great for splitting up averages, but it is not the rounding that we all learned in school. This means that most users and developers will be surprised by the output of any math that uses any of the .NET Round implementations, which by definition makes it a bug. The most compelling argument to use MidPointRounding.AwayFromZero as the 3rd parameter when calling Math.Round is because this is the way it is done in nearly every other programming language including JavaScript and Transact-SQL.
