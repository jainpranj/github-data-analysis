"bionic: Fix wrong kernel_id in pthread descriptor after fork() After forking, the kernel_id field in the phtread_internal_t returned by pthread_self() is incorrect --- it's the tid from the parent, not the new tid of the child. The root cause is that: currently the kernel_id is set by _init_thread(), which is called in 2 cases: (1) called by __libc_init_common(). That happens when the execv( ) is called after fork( ). But when the zygote tries to fork the android application, the child application doesn't call execv( ), instread, it tries to call the Java main method directly. (2) called by pthread_create(). That happens when a new thread is created. For the lead thread which is the thread created by fork(), it should call execv() but it doesn't, as described in (1) above. So its kernel_id will inherit the parent's kernel_id. Fixed it in this patch.

"Avoid getting blocked waiting for too long in eventloop (issue #69). For some reason processEvents does not return at once once the neo modem is suspended. While the WaitForMoreEvents is probably required to avoid running in a tight loop while the handlers get run, setting a 0.1s timeout prevents waiting for too long for any events that are of no concern to us, and give the neo instant suspend/resume. But it still looks like a workaround, why would processEvents wait for more events after it has handled one event, that's not the documented semantics for WaitForMoreEvents.",C++

"ceph: fix up the types of the file layout helpers The helper macros for accessing file layout fields of an on-disk ceph file layout structure cast their results to type (__s32). This is a bit strange, since (with one exception--fl_pg_preferred): - there is no need for negative values; and - all users of these macros are assigning their result to 64-bit variables. So just make these macros return a 64-bit unsigned type. The exception is the preferred placement group, which remains a signed 32-bit value. A placement group id encodes the preferred primary OSD in a 16-bit value, and there's no sense at this point getting too far away from that. Signed-off-by: Alex Elder <elder@dreamhost.com>",C

"Fix a bug in the Arbitrary instance for SettingID. The SettingID type is almost an enumeration, except for the SettingsOther variant, which is designed as a catch-all for setting IDs that we don't understand. When generating arbitrary SettingIDs, we need to make sure that for the SettingsOther case, the Word32 that we generate isn't one of the predefined constants associated with the other SettingID variants. Otherwise, a build-parse test (or a to-raw-and-back test involving a SETTINGS frame) can fail. In fact, I had this bug. Since the reserved Word32 values were consecutive, I restricted the Word32s generated for the SettingsOther case to be >= (length fixedValues), where 'fixedValues' holds all the contructor-only variants. But the reserved Word32 values start at 1, not 0! As a result, we'd occasionally generate SettingsOther 8 which in fact conflicts with the reserved Word32 value for SettingsClientCertificateVectorSize The 100 tests for the build-parse test for SettingID would eventually fail after a few tries, and so would the to-raw-and-back test for Frames, but you could also run them several times without a failure. I've run them more than 100 times now without any failures, so I think I've caught the problem.",Haskell

"(#XXXXX) Fix broken compatibility with Puppet 2.6 Without this patch, the previous change set to the validate_absolute_path() parser function contains Puppet 2.6 incompatible changes. stdlib 2.x is compatible with Puppet 2.6. These changes are a problem because we cannot introduce backwards incompatible changes in a minor release. This patch fixes the problem by back porting the implementation of the `Puppet::Util.absolute_path?` from 2.7.x to the function block itself. The function block tests to see if `Puppet::Util.absolute_path?` will respond and if not, falls back to the inline back ported implementation.

"Significantly increase the length allowed for SQL statements in the general-query functions, increase the max number of bind variables, add some checks when possibly reaching that limit (in certain general-query functions), and add an error code for that limit.

This was found by Mike Wan debugging some 'ireg' issues at an iPlant site.

"Fixes #66 Attribute/DTD-default aware output processor. This fix goes far beyond moving the contrib code to core. Instead, adds a new flag property to Attribute, which indicates whether that Attribute is specified as part of the XML input document, or added as a default by the DTD. The JDOM SAXHandler respects the Attributes2.isSpecified() methods to in turn set the isSPecified flag on the Attribute. The end result is that the isSpecified flag is set on all Attributes unless the attribute was provided by a Default (or 'fixed') DTD declaration. I cannot find comprehensive documentation for it, but it appears that at least the Xerces parser also manages the specified flag for XML Schema derived attributes. Additionally, the Format class has been extended to support the isSpecifiedAttributesOnly() method. This can be set with Format.setSpecifiedAttributesOnly(boolean). All the Outputters (XML, SAX, StAX, DOM) honour the Format.isSpecifiedAttributesOnly() flag. As a consequence, you can now easily exclude those attributes which are created only by DTD (XML Schema) devices when outputting your XML. The Attribute class itself has been modified to set the specified flag to true if any change is direclty made to the Attribute. The logic being that, if you change the attribute, then it is not what was set in the DTD, and it is now 'specified'.",Java

"Fix issue with cobbler system reboot Commit 659a2e5b tried to fix a stack trace with cobbler system reboot without a --name option, but instead completely broke system reboot. Rather than actually reboot the system, issuing `cobbler system reboot --name=...' would result in the corresponding system being saved in the backend. Fix this by first obtaining all valid actions up-front in a python 2.4-compatible way. Then, re-order the action conditionals to check the three that don't require a name parameter first, followed by any valid action. If it's a valid name-requiring action without a name option, quit with a warning. Otherwise, fall down into the appropriate handler block, but actually do 'reboot' in the right place (not as a save operation). Signed-off-by: Nishanth Aravamudan <nacc@us.ibm.com>",Python

"compat: backport CPU mask affinity hint We cannot backport this given that the IRQ data structure was changed so simply treat this hint as if the system was uniprocessor. This backports this commit: commit e7a297b0d7d6049bd4e423ac1e17da31e4c401b8 Author: Peter P Waskiewicz Jr <peter.p.waskiewicz.jr@intel.com> Date: Fri Apr 30 14:44:50 2010 -0700 genirq: Add CPU mask affinity hint This patch adds a cpumask affinity hint to the irq_desc structure, along with a registration function and a read-only proc entry for each interrupt. This affinity_hint handle for each interrupt can be used by underlying drivers that need a better mechanism to control interrupt affinity. The underlying driver can register a cpumask for the interrupt, which will allow the driver to provide the CPU mask for the interrupt to anything that requests it. The intent is to extend the userspace daemon, irqbalance, to help hint to it a preferred CPU mask to balance the interrupt into.

"Backport ""disappearing SD media"" fixes from CM9. commit 6892e3b47fd2751dd60d3e47c0cd6c3f2677fabd Author: Mike Kasick <mike@kasick.org> Date: Sat Mar 3 23:23:08 2012 -0500 Check external storage volume ID to ensure media is actually mounted. Programs may request to media scan files (via MediaScannerConnection::scanFile) before external storage is mounted. If that happens, MediaProvider creates an external-ffffffff.db (volume ID -1) database once external storage is mounted, instead of the one with the expected volume ID. Later, if android.process.media is killed and respawned, the real external database (that is, the one corresponding to the actual external storage volume ID) is attached. At best, that database contains stale records. However, in conjunction with another bug (where the LRU database garbage collector prunes all but one external database), most often a new, empty database is created. This results in the sudden disappearance of all ringtones and media from programs that depend on the media database. commit c2d7096ab162e8e81ded17496c61b2f0efd35ed0 Author: Mike Kasick <mike@kasick.org> Date: Sun Mar 4 15:00:04 2012 -0500 Fix deletion of least-recently-used external databases. The present external database LRU garbage collector mistakenly includes SQLite temporary files, including those associated with the internal database, as distinct external databases. This leads to a number of problems, including partial deletion of databases and/or their temporary files and early deletion of databases before the MAX_EXTERNAL_DATABASES limit is reached. In short, the present code works only, and coincidentally, in a single circumstance: when there is an internal database and _exactly one_ external database. This fixes the above problem by removing SQLite temporary files from the list of candidate databases, and later ensures that all files associated with a deleted database are deleted as well. Note, it's quite possible that the actual bug here is in the android.app.ContextImpl::databaseList and ContextImpl::deleteDatabase methods, which return SQLite temporary files as part of a context's ""database list"" instead of hiding them and handling their deletion internally. However, since these methods are part of the Android public API and used by third-party apps, the present fix is implemented in MediaProvider only. Should the Context database API be altered, this fix will be made redundant but remain unharmful.",Java

"PM: Make it possible to avoid races between wakeup and system sleep. One of the arguments during the suspend blockers discussion was that the mainline kernel didn't contain any mechanisms making it possible to avoid races between wakeup and system suspend. Generally, there are two problems in that area. First, if a wakeup event occurs exactly when /sys/power/state is being written to, it may be delivered to user space right before the freezer kicks in, so the user space consumer of the event may not be able to process it before the system is suspended. Second, if a wakeup event occurs after user space has been frozen, it is not generally guaranteed that the ongoing transition of the system into a sleep state will be aborted. To address these issues introduce a new global sysfs attribute, /sys/power/wakeup_count, associated with a running counter of wakeup events and three helper functions, pm_stay_awake(), pm_relax(), and pm_wakeup_event(), that may be used by kernel subsystems to control the behavior of this attribute and to request the PM core to abort system transitions into a sleep state already in progress. The /sys/power/wakeup_count file may be read from or written to by user space. Reads will always succeed (unless interrupted by a signal) and return the current value of the wakeup events counter. Writes, however, will only succeed if the written number is equal to the current value of the wakeup events counter. If a write is successful, it will cause the kernel to save the current value of the wakeup events counter and to abort the subsequent system transition into a sleep state if any wakeup events are reported after the write has returned. [The assumption is that before writing to /sys/power/state user space will first read from /sys/power/wakeup_count. Next, user space consumers of wakeup events will have a chance to acknowledge or veto the upcoming system transition to a sleep state. Finally, if the transition is allowed to proceed, /sys/power/wakeup_count will be written to and if that succeeds, /sys/power/state will be written to as well. Still, if any wakeup events are reported to the PM core by kernel subsystems after that point, the transition will be aborted.] Additionally, put a wakeup events counter into struct dev_pm_info and make these per-device wakeup event counters available via sysfs, so that it's possible to check the activity of various wakeup event sources within the kernel. To illustrate how subsystems can use pm_wakeup_event(), make the low-level PCI runtime PM wakeup-handling code use it. Signed-off-by: Rafael J.

"Fix RingBuffer starvation when playing .nuv files. In the original code, the estimated bitrate for .nuv files was set to 0, and downstream code would figure out a suitable blocksize for ringbuffer fills. After the low-bitrate optimizations in #9824, the blocksize ended up being reduced to 2KB.

"drm/radeon: Set DESKTOP_HEIGHT register to the framebuffer (not mode) height. commit 1b61925061660009f5b8047f93c5297e04541273 upstream. The value of this register is transferred to the V_COUNTER register at the beginning of vertical blank. V_COUNTER is the reference for VLINE waits and goes from VIEWPORT_Y_START to VIEWPORT_Y_START+VIEWPORT_HEIGHT during scanout, so if VIEWPORT_Y_START is not 0, V_COUNTER actually went backwards at the beginning of vertical blank, and VLINE waits excluding the whole scanout area could never finish (possibly only if VIEWPORT_Y_START is larger than the length of vertical blank in scanlines). Setting DESKTOP_HEIGHT to the framebuffer height should prevent this for any kind of VLINE wait. Fixes https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=45329 .

Fix gh-#2065 Replace 'SMC' in ECLWatch/ConfigMgr UI Existing ECLWatch Permission area shows 'SMC' as feature name. This fix changes it to better names. Most of the changes are in environment.xml and other deployment scripts which create the term into esp.xml. It is decided to rename the 'ESP Services for SMC' to be 'ESP Services for management console' and rename the 'Root access to SMC service' to be 'Base access to ESP services'. This fix also changes the term 'espsmc' to 'eclwatch'. Signed-off-by: Kevin Wang <kevin.wang@lexisnexis.com>,C++

"Change delegate work computation We were delegating too much work. The original algorithm description said that for each insert, ""1"" unit of merge work has to be done *at each level* â¦ implying that if nothing needs doing at a level, that ""not done work"" does not add to work done elsewhere. This fix gets us back to that situation (by always subtracting at least 2^TOP_LEVEL from the presented work amount), while maintaining the (beneficial) effect of chunking merge work at at anything but the last level. Effectively, this reduces the maximum amount of merge work done, also reducing our worst case latency. Now that we understand this, we can refactor the algorithm to delegate ""DoneWork"", because then each level can determine the total work, and see if any work is left ""for me"". That's next.",Erlang

"For the annals of subtle but terrible bugs: fix a longstanding bug in vtable layout where virtual methods inherited from virtual bases could be assigned the same vcall adjustment slot if they shared a name and parameter signature but differed in their cv-qualification.

Thus preventing typos in future commands based on the existing ones. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- by fabpot at 2012-02-09T06:26:07Z That breaks the unit tests. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- by Tobion at 2012-02-09T17:05:06Z fixed --------------------------------------------------------------------------- by stof at 2012-02-09T17:43:47Z can you rebase your branch please ? it conflicts with master --------------------------------------------------------------------------- by stof at 2012-02-09T17:44:11Z the reason is simple: SwiftmailerBundle is gone :) --------------------------------------------------------------------------- by Tobion at 2012-02-09T23:23:23Z done --------------------------------------------------------------------------- by fabpot at 2012-02-11T23:47:10Z Can you squash your commit before I merge this PR? Thanks. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- by Tobion at 2012-02-12T13:57:14Z I'm unable to squash it into 1 commit because of the uptream commits inside. I hope it's fine now. If not someone needs to help me. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- by stof at 2012-02-12T14:27:38Z ``git rebase -i upstream/master`` should allow you rebasing things and squashing them toghter (changing the action for the second commit to ``squash``) --------------------------------------------------------------------------- by Tobion at 2012-02-12T14:47:29Z first i tried with git rebase -i head~4 (4 commits), but this showed many more external commits. second I tried git reset --soft with a clean commit, but still no success. then I used your proposal. and there are always conflicts of stuff that is not part of my PR. now the diff is messed up... this is frustrating --------------------------------------------------------------------------- by stof at 2012-02-12T14:58:43Z The only reason why the diff is messed is because you messed it when resolving the conflicts by choosing the wrong result for the output. Please fix things as it means that merging your PR would revert changes done previosuly --------------------------------------------------------------------------- by stof at 2012-02-12T15:00:18Z Basically, you reverted most of the changes done in Symfony the few last days. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- by Tobion at 2012-02-12T15:10:59Z I used `git checkout --theirs .` when resolving. Whats the correct way? --------------------------------------------------------------------------- by stof at 2012-02-12T15:13:21Z Well, I generally resolve the conflicts myself instead of asking git to use one version, as generally the final code is not one of the versions by a mix of both versions (as both sides are likely to have done useful changes) --------------------------------------------------------------------------- by Tobion at 2012-02-12T15:15:02Z Yes but the conflicts are in files I never touched and that are not part of my changes. I cannot resolve hundreds of files by hand. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- by Tobion at 2012-02-12T15:41:31Z Finally it worked. I used git reset head~1 and then discarded all foreign changes. There you go. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- by Tobion at 2012-02-14T14:06:04Z @fabpot ping --------------------------------------------------------------------------- by Tobion at 2012-02-20T18:20:50Z @fabpot ping --------------------------------------------------------------------------- by stof at 2012-03-02T22:14:49Z @Tobion the branch needs to be rebased. It conflicts with master --------------------------------------------------------------------------- by Tobion at 2012-03-21T04:22:10Z All done.

"bug 14042: Don't set dhcp:router option on DHCP server for non-default network on CentOS/RHEL The routing table with two nics may be messed up, due to we sent same router(gateway) information from different DHCP server, in order to specify default gateway. E.g. Network A: 192.168.1.0/24, gw 192.168.1.1 Network B: 192.168.2.0/24, gw 192.168.2.1 User VM: Nic 1 connect to network A, get ip 192.168.1.10; nic 2 connect to network B, get ip 192.168.2.10. Set network A as the default network of user VM. Currently we would send this information to user VM through DHCP offer: In network A: dhcp-option:router 192.168.1.1 In network B: dhcp-option:router 192.168.1.1 So both NIC in the guest VM would receive 192.168.1.1 as router(gateway). But, in CentOS 5.6, dhclient-scripts try to tell if the gateway is reachable for current subnet. So when we try to enable nic 2(eth1) of user VM, dhclient would receive: IP: 192.168.2.10 Mask: 255.255.255.0 Router: 192.168.1.1 Then it would found that the specified gateway(router) is not within its own subnet(192.168.2.0/24). But since we send out this ip(192.168.1.1) as the gateway for it, dhclient thought that it should got someway to access the network through this IP. So it would execute: ip route add 192.168.1.1 dev eth1 ip route replace default via 192.168.1.1 dev eth1 But it can never reach 192.168.1.1(which is in the eth0's subnet and the gateway of eth0) by go through eth1 interface. So it is messed up. We've tested Windows 2008 R2, CentOS 5.3, CentOS 5.6 and Ubuntu 10.04. Windows and Ubuntu are fine with above policy. To solve this, we send different dhcp:router option according to the guest OS type now.

I add an item, which takes a long time 2. I delete that item (this queues a callback) 3. I undo the deletion (this calls set_item_id(li, null)), which triggers callbacks, which tries to api_call('DELETE'), which queues a callback. I don't know what happens when you add items to a list while iterating over that list. Infinite loop? Note that the code still has more races of this kind.

"merged branch vicb/form/guess/length (PR #3645) Commits ------- fc7c7f6 [Form] Fix min/max length guessing for numeric types (fix #3091) Discussion ---------- [Form] Fix min/max length guessing for numeric types (fix #3091) Before this PR, the length was guessed from `strlen(min/max)`. This is obviously false for float: `strlen(""1.123"") > strlen (""5"")` then this guess is now low confidence only and is masked by a `null` medium confidence guess for floats (implemented in both doctrine ORM & validator). This PR also includes some code reorg in order to improve readability.

"dahdi_dynamic: Since dynamic devices are 'parentless' we must name them. This in conjunction with r10449 ""A parent-less device should not crash dahdi"", this allows dahdi_dynamic spans to work post the dahdi_devices changes in 2.6.0. The full address of the device is not used since kernels prior to 2.6.31 limit the length of a devicename to 20 characters.

"WriteLOBs storage component and 2 implementations Factor out the LOB Writing code through an API from ::Sybase::ASE into a generic component, ::Storage::DBI::WriteLOBs which requires the composing class to implement just two methods, _write_lobs and _empty_lob and implements insert, update and insert_bulk as well as a bunch of low level methods (which are private.) These methods are documented in the component as top comments. ::DBI::Oracle::Generic and ::Sybase::ASE implement this component. The implementation is stackable, so that a composing class override of LOB handling using the low level methods will not conflict with the inherited methods, however for performance reasons a flag has been added: local $self->{_skip_writelobs_impl} = 1; to shortcircuit the implementation even faster. This flag is not documented and will be replaced using the capability system in the future, it is used in the ASE implementation of insert_bulk because of the special identities handling it requires. This refactor addresses a number of issues: - rows can now be identified by unique constraints, not just PKs for LOB ops - ASE UPDATEs with LIKE queries on TEXT columns in the WHERE condition now work - LOB ops now work in Oracle with quoting turned on - LOB ops work in Oracle with DBD::Oracle 1.23 - insert_bulk now works with LOBs for Oracle, as long as the slices can be uniquely identified",Perl

Since the buffer was disabled, ob_end_flush would generate an error message, which would be tacked on to the end of the xml report. This change fixes this by replacing ob_end_clean with ob_clean, which also deletes the current contents of the buffer, but does not disable buffering.",PHP

New permission nodes: treasurechest.list treasurechest.list.all treasurechest.random treasurechest.ignoreprotection treasurechest.admin (default for OP, grants all permissions) treasurechest.player (default false, grants all permissions a player would normally get) And these are the new commands: /tchest random [amount of randomly chosen stacks] /tchest ignoreprotection /tchest list /tchest list -all",Java

"Potentially large performance fixes all around- 1. Blocks that are KNOWN and GUARANTEED to return a null protection are now stored in a cache. This will decrease the number of database queries overall. This cache is 10 times larger than cacheSize because it uses a flat integer and uses very very little memory for the amount of benefit it can potentially get over time. 2. Protection finders have been optimized. Now, instead of trying every finder, only the relevent finders will be used. For example, if the player clicked on a double chest, LWC will only use the double chest finder, not the others (which would be used in turn if no protection existed on the double chest.) None of the protection finders now should query the database. It should more strictly either return TRUE if there is a match in blocks (but not a protection, which may not exist), and FALSE if there is no match at all. These changes will more be noticeable in the long run. Database calls seem expensive but by adding another cache and removing places where queries were previously done (unnecessarily), should help.",Java

"3109: Pow._eval_power rules more accurate The rules for combining (x**a)**b into x**(a*b) have been updated; the conditions are enumerated in Pow._eval_power. The same sort of thing should also be done to exp (see issue 3109). Here are comments about the old rules: Formerly- The following was ok: - if other.is_integer: - return Pow(b, e * other) The condition that other.is_real should not be added; if e is complex then the joined exponent may not be valid, e.g. (3**(4*I))**(1/2) != 3**(2*I) if b.is_nonnegative and (e.is_real or other.is_real): - return Pow(b, e * other) ok: - if e.is_even and b.is_real: # hence b is pos and e is real - return Pow(abs(b), e * other) only valid if e.is_real and then it's true whether other is real or not - if abs(e) < S.One and other.is_real: - return Pow(b, e * other) ok (if that's how exp_polar should behave) - if b.is_polar: - return Pow(b, e * other) The rules above are missing the handling of possible complex powers where e.is_real is False and abs(e) < S.Pi/abs(log(b)) and the simple case where other is a multiple of 1/2 and abs(e) < S.Pi/abs(log(b)) This function can be used to test whether two exponents should combine. if False is printed, then (e**a)**b should not become e**(a*b) and the difference between (e**a)**b and e**(a*b) is printed. >>> def foo(a,b,e=E): ... ib=S(1)/b;print abs(a*log(e)/pi).n() < 1 ... return ((e**a).n()**ib - e**(a*ib)).n(chop=1e-10) ... >>> foo(2*I,3,6*I) False 0.0892124078593689 - 0.601228142633338*I >>> foo(I/3,3,6*I) True 0",Python

First, and most importantly, if the output buffering nesting level is greater than the counter, the function does not perform the expected task.

What can be done: -run fix_permissions in Android OS mode, not in recovery mode. As you may know fix_permissions in CWM recovery is broken; -Fix/Undo Fix Market Cache Download; -Flash new Recovery; -Mount/Unmount any partition in recovery mode, Remount /system with read-write/read-only access in Android OS mode; -Repartitioning SD Card with /sd-ext partition (your choice of size and type) with option to backup /sdcard content before, and restoring it after the operation; -Wipe data/factory reset, cache, dalvik-cache, battery stats (your choice) in recovery mode; -Install zip of your choice from /sdcard; -Backup ROM to any folder on /sdcard or to default CWM location with option for Backup md5 sum validation after phone reboots back to Android OS, ensures proper backup is done; -Restore nandroid Backup with option to choose which partitions to restore(select all for full restore) and preliminary md5 sum validation for double safety; -One click Update ROM function which wipes cache and dalvik-cache before flashing. If Link2SD is detected on your phone you have an option to automatically copy its sd-ext mount script from current ROM to the new updated ROM saving you one reboot. Link2SD will not even know you updated the ROM; -One click ROM Flash with full wipe and options to install zips before/after(or both) the flash - this procedure reboots phone to Recovery, wipes dalvik-cache, formats /boot, /system, /data and /cache partitions, installs zip before(if selected), installs the new ROM, installs zip after(if selected) and reboots back to Android OS.

After phone reboots back to Android OS, the last CWM recovery log is displayed so you can spot any errors occurred during the last operation. -Shell Page is replaced with Command Prompt ""adb shell"" window; -Messages Page removed (couldn't get it to work); -And probably something else I forgot about; All bugs fixed(I believe).

"A first model of the map Added a Location-class which can either take a string or longitud/latitud as input. Converts and stores as String either way. This could be an issue, maybe we want to display latitud/longitud sometimes? This however is more convenient for the URLBuilder. The URLBuilder takes some input (eg where markers should be etc) and returns an url to a static map image. For more specific features, read the code (mostly the field declarations) or ask me (Florian) in person. Another way of doing this would be to type https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/staticmaps/ into your browser. The MapModel class contains ALL data related to the map properties. The URLBuilder takes some of this as input and returns a link. This is just the first iteration. More work has to be done.",Java

"Rework the crazy hotpatching we do on Chef to work around upstream bugs. This replaces the ad-hoc patching stuff that used to live in install-chef.sh and chef-install with something a little easier to update. Specifically: * Instead of swapping out whole files, we carry around unified diffs and patch them into the right files one at a time. This way we can detect when a patch no longer applies cleanly (hopefully because it got fixed upstream) and die early instead of merrily rolling along and possibly breaking things later on. * There is a little more structure in how patches are applied. Instead of hand-editing the varoius install scripts, we have a patch.sh that knows how to find files that we want to patch and that handles the patching. * install-chef.sh knows how to tar up all the patches along with the patch application script so that client nodes can download and apply patches as part of crowbar_join.sh.",Shell

"What is different from current official build 0.8.1: Files Page: -double click on phone file (both panes) opens file in PC with the associated program for that extension with option to edit the file and save it back to phone; -added ""Properties"" in phone files/folders right click context menu with permissions changing capabilities; -switching left pane between PC/phone files now remembers last folder view for both; -left paths combo box now works for phone files too when switching left pane to phone files; -some bugs fixes; Apps Page: -major speedup displaying apps after the initial first run when apps info is collected; -fixed all functions, now all buttons and actions works as they should; -now you can backup and restore apps and data to any folder on /sdcard or PC, set backup folder location in Settings first; -option added to Backups context menu to add app/data if missing from existing previous backup; Recovery Page replaced with new Advanced Menu Page that works with CWM Recovery. What can be done: -run fix_permissions in Android OS mode, not in recovery mode. As you may know fix_permissions in CWM recovery is broken; -Fix/Undo Fix Market Cache Download; -Flash new Recovery; -Mount/Unmount any partition in recovery mode, Remount /system with read-write/read-only access in Android OS mode; -Repartitioning SD Card with /sd-ext partition (your choice of size and type) with option to backup /sdcard content before, and restoring it after the operation; -Wipe data/factory reset, cache, dalvik-cache, battery stats (your choice) in recovery mode; -Install zip of your choice from /sdcard; -Backup ROM to any folder on /sdcard or to default CWM location with option for Backup md5 sum validation after phone reboots back to Android OS, ensures proper backup is done; -Restore nandroid Backup with option to choose which partitions to restore(select all for full restore) and preliminary md5 sum validation for double safety; -One click Update ROM function which wipes cache and dalvik-cache before flashing. If Link2SD is detected on your phone you have an option to automatically copy its sd-ext mount script from current ROM to the new updated ROM saving you one reboot. Link2SD will not even know you updated the ROM; -One click ROM Flash with full wipe and options to install zips before/after(or both) the flash - this procedure reboots phone to Recovery, wipes dalvik-cache, formats /boot, /system, /data and /cache partitions, installs zip before(if selected), installs the new ROM, installs zip after(if selected) and reboots back to Android OS. Detailed information in Status Window is displayed for all operations taking place in real time. After phone reboots back to Android OS, the last CWM recovery log is displayed so you can spot any errors occurred during the last operation. -Shell Page is replaced with Command Prompt ""adb shell"" window; -And probably something else I forgot about; All bugs fixed(I believe). I want to thank and give credits to the guys (couldn't find their names) created some of the tools I'm using to make the new features works.",C++

"Add zio constructor/destructor Add a standard zio constructor and destructor. Normally, this is done to reduce to cost of allocating a new structure by reducing expensive operations such as memory allocations. However, in this case none of the operations moved out of zio_create() were really very expensive. This change was principly made as a debug patch (and workaround) for a zio_destroy() race. The is good evidence that zio_create() is reinitializing a mutex which is really still in use by another thread. This would completely explain the observed symptoms in the issue report. This patch doesn't fix the root cause of the race, but it should make it less likely by only initializing the mutex once in the constructor. Also, this particular flaw might have gone unnoticed in other zfs implementations due to the specific implementation details of Linux ticket spinlocks. Once the real root cause is determined and resolved this change can be safely reverted. Until then this should help workaround the issue.

"Reworked ffmpeg exporters to work with mythffmpeg Although there is doubtless more cleanup to do as a result of this, nuvexport now uses the ffmpeg build provided by mythtv itself as part of it builds. This is as of MythTV/mythtv@8c6de4675d6d3ba234999611d35901953074b1d2 All of the ffmpeg exporters have been tested with this setup. Additionally, sox is now used to downsample 6-channel audio to 2-channel before encoding. This should fix the reported problems of encoding from AC-3 audio. I may refactor the dependency later so it only checks for sox if it's needed for the particular job at hand.

A fix is trivial but as I am not profficient with git and am discouraged from fixing it directly. Also, 2.6.39 has removed the .get_sb field and only supports the .mount field in file_system_type struct. I attach a non-git patch that seems to work ok. It tests for kernel version >= 2.6.39 but as this probably applies to previous kernels it may be better to #define USE_MOUNT_FIELD conditional of some previous kernel threshold and use that instead.

"Fix SST handling of resending unacked packets. Resending unacked packets could get stuck in an infinite loop since it always rescheduled stream servicing. Once it hit that code once, if the RTO*2 stayed below the arbitrary constant we had used, servicing would continue indefinitely even though there was nothing to do. Instead, make rescheduling dependent on whether there are unacked packets and just use the same scheduling as the regular processing code instead of potentially posting another service call twice. This fixes the infinite servicing loop we could hit with streams that should have been doing nothing except sending keepalives. The keepalives were enough to trigger the infinite 'loop'.",C++

"NEW: Gate One now supports dropping privileges! See below for details... utils.py: Added drop_privileges() so we can run as a user/group other than root. gateone.py: Gate One now supports --uid and --gid to enable dropping of privileges. These two options can take a string or an integer (e.g. 'gateone' or '1005' will work). This means that if you run Gate One as root it will open the listening port (e.g. 443) and then drop to the given user/group. It automatically tries to fix the permissions of writable directories (user_dir, session_dir, logs, etc) and does its best to figure out what supplemental group owns /dev/pts so it can be added to the executing supplemental groups. gateone.py: Many directories that were previously created with chmod 0700 are now being created using 0770 (in case someone wants to manage access based on the owning group). gateone.py: Added two new plugin hooks that allow arbitrary code to be placed in the header and body of index.html. This is primarily to make it easier for plugins to include 3rd party JavaScript libraries but it should also be an all-around useful feature. ssh_connect.py: Added the ability to specify a default_host for all connections. This will allow you to have something other than [localhost] in the SSH connection prompt. Also, if you pass this option an empty string (--default_host="""") it will force the user to enter a valid hostname (i.e. no default). This should take care of the following feature request: https://github.com/liftoff/GateOne/issues/94",Python

"Bug: turn on SD_FAST_XFER_AKTIV and compilation fails if PID is enabled. Fix: If SD_FAST_XFER_AKTIV is defined, fast_xfer() only declares g_heater_pwm_val if PIDTEMP is defined, but later assigns g_heater_pwm_val=0 regardless whether PIDTEMP is defined or not. If PIDTEMP is undefined, g_heater_pwm_val is undeclared at compile time and generates the appropriate error. I solved by not using g_heater_pwm_val if PIDTEMP is undefined (and therefor undeclared.) Also, the extern declaration was as an int, when g_heater_pwm_val is defined as a volatile unsigned char. This caused a duplicate declaration error, which was solved by changing the declaration in fast_xfer() to match the definition. I didn't dig deeper to try to understand if the mismatch was intentional or test operation other than verify the compile errors no longer occur.",C

"Eliminate a copy in syntax::parse::new_parser_from_file Fixing a FIXME turned out to be pretty involved. I added an io function that returns a unique boxed string (for the contents of a file) rather than a string, and went from there. Also made the src field of codemap a unique boxed string. This doesn't seem to make that much difference in amount of allocation according to valgrind (disappointingly), but I also had to introduce a copy somewhere else pending a new snapshot, so maybe that's it.",Rust

"Converge all SQL-level statistics timing values to float8 milliseconds. This patch adjusts the core statistics views to match the decision already taken for pg_stat_statements, that values representing elapsed time should be represented as float8 and measured in milliseconds. By using float8, we are no longer tied to a specific maximum precision of timing data. (Internally, it's still microseconds, but we could now change that without needing changes at the SQL level.) The columns affected are pg_stat_bgwriter.checkpoint_write_time pg_stat_bgwriter.checkpoint_sync_time pg_stat_database.blk_read_time pg_stat_database.blk_write_time pg_stat_user_functions.total_time pg_stat_user_functions.self_time pg_stat_xact_user_functions.total_time pg_stat_xact_user_functions.self_time The first four of these are new in 9.2, so there is no compatibility issue from changing them. The others require a release note comment that they are now double precision (and can show a fractional part) rather than bigint as before; also their underlying statistics functions now match the column definitions, instead of returning bigint microseconds.",C

"Move connection cache from ""AphrontDatabaseConnection""-level to ""LiskDAO""-level Summary: - Currently, connections are responsible for connection caching. However, I want unit tests to be able to say ""throw away the entire connection cache"" with storage fixtures, and this is difficult/impossible when connections are responsible for the cache. - The only behavioral change is that previously we would use the same connection for read-mode and write-mode queries. We'll now establish two connections. No installs actually differentiate between the modes so it isn't particularly relevant what we do here. In the long term, we should probably check the ""w"" cache before building a new ""r"" connection, so transactional code which involves reads and writes works (we don't have any such code right now). Test Plan: Loaded pages, verified only one connection was established per database. Ran unit tests.

"v0.99.44 hide vegdist() and rdacca.phyloseq wrappers Lots of other improvements * Make the phyloseq::vegdist() wrapper an internal function. Documentation updated as well. This is a solution to Issue 87 https://github.com/joey711/phyloseq/issues/87 * Remove rda.phyloseq and cca.phyloseq from exported methods. Documentation had already been removed when these were first attempted to be converted to internal methods in v0.99.42 * Modify make_sample_network to use the new distance() function, and be able to pass on additional parameters to distance(). * Re-order arguments to make_sample_network to better represent the stability of defaults. * Removed redundant parameters from make_sample_network(). Transformations to abundance tables should be performed upstream using phyloseq tools, not embedded in this function. * Modify vignettes to reflect these changes. * Rebuild vignette. * Update import() documentation to reflect support for BIOM format, import_biom() function.",R

"Fix gesture detection This commit addresses 2 issues: 1) Before, a general GestureDetector was registered on the highest level in K9Activity This resulted in EVERY inherited activity to have a useless, unused gesture detector. But more than that, in MessageList, a second GestureDetector was assigned to the ListView. On every fling gesture, both detectors called the onSwipe() methods, which technically did the following: - The one directly assigned to the ListView would work corectly by mapping the (local) event coordinates to the right entry in the ListView - The global one worked on screen coordinates, so the onSwipe() method would likely select the wrong ListView entry (system menu bar offset). - For some reason this ""worked"" fine, and only the correct entry was selected, despite two detectors used. 2) The gesture detection for the MessageView caused problems when the message itself was scrollable, i.e. wide HTML mails. A fling gesture inside the WebView would scroll the message, but also switch the message. This commit fixes all those by doing the following: - Don't register the GestureDetector in K9Activity, instead make the member variable accessible by subclasses. - In the subclasses that need a detector register it - In K9Activity.dispatchTouchEvent() check for mGestureDetector being null - For MessageList: * Remove the duplicate gesture detector assigned to the ListView * in the handleSwipe() methods: calclulate pixel offset of the ListView to make it work using the global screen coordinates - For MessageView: Limit sensitive area to the message header, to prevent interference with the WebView scrolling - Respect current behavior: * Force-enable gestures for the MessageList * Respect user setting in MessageView - Make sure that after a successful swipe gesture, any pending action is cancelled, to prevent unwanted things to happen (such as expanding the header after changing the message, or a context menu popping up in the MessageList).

"Fix JRUBY-6280: Fails to open fifo for writing. It turns out that in glibc, fopen operations that would seek in the resulting file descriptor do actually check for ESPIPE to know that a failed seek is due to the file being a pipe or FIFO. We do not have direct access to the actual ESPIPE, but we can check the IOException message to know if it's the same problem. I don't think there's any real risk in this change, since it will only quietly fail to seek on a file when it's impossible to seek on that file, which is what we want. Other error cases and open failures should propagate as before.",Ruby

"Daregress refactoring/cleanup Major refactoring on daregress suite, with a better way of adding new tests and a simpler error report. Also, added a transaction test to the list. While refactoring, I cleaned up a bit of the code and found three issues with the current implementation: 1. While creating a new superfile within a transaction, the pointer returned was the result of a dir-lookup, so in the case of active transactions, it'd be NULL. This bug is fixed with the current patch. 2. I managed to reduce the window to which a newly created superfile would be available in the filesystem, even before commit, by locking it straight after creation. There's still a tiny gap (heavy loaded systems might hit it) in between the two lines. 3. If adding the creation of the superfile inside the transaction, in the tests' conditions (which might not be correct), the sub files are not added. Since this works with FileServices, I'm guessing it's something wrong with the test, and not the DFS itself. Will create an issue on github to investigate.",C++

"Added verification to avoid bootstrapping issues and errors from unavailable functions. - Created custom functions for loading both `org` and `el` init files. - Currently `el` files are simply loaded with `load-file`, however that can be edited in the future. - `Org` files are first loaded within `ignore-errors` to allow them to load if the function is already present (Emacs24). If `org-babel-load-file` is not available, the loading is wrapped in `eval-after-load 'org-install` which will load the customizations once `org` is available. - If Org is being tracked outside of `el-get` it must be loaded before el-get, or using `(require 'org-install)` and not `(require 'org)`, otherwise customization packages will not be loaded. Minor change: - Changed `plain-type` to `el-type` to be more clear in what it does.",Emacs Lisp

"exynos4: Disable SW downclock in cpuidle The Samsung 3.0.x source includes a new exynos4 feature: reducing CPU clock when in idle. However, this seems pointless as the CPU clock gets gated in this state anyway. Also, the logic for doing this seems to sometimes hang, as there are occasional cases of the RCU stall detector going off due to CPU1 getting stuck in exynos4_enter_idle() This issue seems to go away when disabling the SW downclock feature with not much negative effect on battery, so disable it for now until it can be revisited.

"Allow decorative brush resizers. The brush component now allows you to add decorative elements to serve as brush resizers, while keeping the default behavior of a few invisible pixels on the edge of the extent. Any element you add to "".resize"" containers can serve as visible handles for the brush. This commit also fixes two small bugs with the brush component. First, we now track the offset between the extent edge and the mouse, rather than immediately jumping the extent edge to the mouse position; this was barely noticeable previously due to the resizers being so thin, but it is very noticeable with large resizers. Second, the default behavior for the SPACE key is not prevented whilst dragging.",JavaScript

"Updating Trackable::association_hash to always write child relationship name. Currently there are cases (on destroy mainly) where an embedded document would write it's class name to the association hash name field, when it fails to lookup the relationship meta information pertaining to it's parent. Then, if you are trying to use that history track later on, it would fail to be able to lookup it's trackable_parent, among other methods, because it would try to traverse a relationship titled ""Comment"" instead of a relationship titled ""comments"". This fix makes it so a child document never fails to lookup the name of the relation it's parent uses to refer to it. Thus class names never get used in child documents.",Ruby

"mm: page allocator: adjust the per-cpu counter threshold when memory . .is low Upstream commit 88f5acf Commit aa45484 (""calculate a better estimate of NR_FREE_PAGES when memory is low"") noted that watermarks were based on the vmstat NR_FREE_PAGES. To avoid synchronization overhead, these counters are maintained on a per-cpu basis and drained both periodically and when a threshold is above a threshold. On large CPU systems, the difference between the estimate and real value of NR_FREE_PAGES can be very high. The system can get into a case where pages are allocated far below the min watermark potentially causing livelock issues. The commit solved the problem by taking a better reading of NR_FREE_PAGES when memory was low. Unfortately, as reported by Shaohua Li this accurate reading can consume a large amount of CPU time on systems with many sockets due to cache line bouncing. This patch takes a different approach. For large machines where counter drift might be unsafe and while kswapd is awake, the per-cpu thresholds for the target pgdat are reduced to limit the level of drift to what should be a safe level. This incurs a performance penalty in heavy memory pressure by a factor that depends on the workload and the machine but the machine should function correctly without accidentally exhausting all memory on a node. There is an additional cost when kswapd wakes and sleeps but the event is not expected to be frequent - in Shaohua's test case, there was one recorded sleep and wake event at least. To ensure that kswapd wakes up, a safe version of zone_watermark_ok() is introduced that takes a more accurate reading of NR_FREE_PAGES when called from wakeup_kswapd, when deciding whether it is really safe to go back to sleep in sleeping_prematurely() and when deciding if a zone is really balanced or not in balance_pgdat(). We are still using an expensive function but limiting how often it is called. When the test case is reproduced, the time spent in the watermark functions is reduced. The following report is on the percentage of time spent cumulatively spent in the functions zone_nr_free_pages(), zone_watermark_ok(), __zone_watermark_ok(), zone_watermark_ok_safe(), zone_page_state_snapshot(), zone_page_state(). vanilla 11.6615% disable-threshold 0.2584% David said: : We had to pull aa45484 ""mm: page allocator: calculate a better estimate : of NR_FREE_PAGES when memory is low and kswapd is awake"" from 2.6.36 : internally because tests showed that it would cause the machine to stall : as the result of heavy kswapd activity. I merged it back with this fix as : it is pending in the -mm tree and it solves the issue we were seeing, so I : definitely think this should be pushed to -stable (and I would seriously : consider it for 2.6.37 inclusion even at this late date).

"iwlagn: fix (remove) use of PAGE_SIZE commit 106671369e6d046c0b3e1e72b18ad6dd9cb298b0 upstream. The ICT code erroneously uses PAGE_SIZE. The bug is that PAGE_SIZE isn't necessarily 4096, so on such platforms this code will not work correctly as we'll try to attempt to read an index in the table that the device never wrote, it always has 4096-byte pages. Additionally, the manual alignment code here is unnecessary -- Documentation/DMA-API-HOWTO.txt states: The cpu return address and the DMA bus master address are both guaranteed to be aligned to the smallest PAGE_SIZE order which is greater than or equal to the requested size. This invariant exists (for example) to guarantee that if you allocate a chunk which is smaller than or equal to 64 kilobytes, the extent of the buffer you receive will not cross a 64K boundary. Just use appropriate new constants and get rid of the alignment code.

This happens if the capture is started with a particular timing with regard to playback. A particular case if when placing an outgoing video chat with gTalk. The problem is with the mechanism used to pass buffers between the capture thread and the preprocessing thread. It is possible that the preprocessing thread locks in with the timing of the capture thread and always gets a condition where buffers are not ready in which case it will read new data from the driver causing every other buffer to be dropped. The fix consists in modifying the buffer sync mechanism and have the preprocessing thread wait for a condition in case the read buffer is not available yet.

"From Ulrich Hertlein, ""as discussed on osg-users there is an issue with clang++ on OS X and iOS that results in the following error: Users/stephan/Documents/Projekte/cefix/cefix/ios/../../libs/ios/include/OpenThreads/Atomic:244:48: error: cannot initialize a parameter of type 'void *' with an lvalue of type 'const void *const' return __sync_bool_compare_and_swap(&_ptr, ptrOld, ptrNew); This can be solved by a cast to '(void*)ptrOld'. This should be benign since both 'ptrOld' and 'ptrNew' are only read and the cast is in fact in place for all other implementations as well. On OS X the cast compiles cleanly on both g++ (i686-apple-darwin11-llvm-g++-4.2 (GCC) 4.2.1) and clang++ (Apple clang version 3.1 (tags/Apple/clang-318.0.54)). """,C++

"Added a new Host class: ReadWriteLock This abstracts read/write locks on the current host system. It is currently backed by pthread_rwlock_t objects so it should work on all unix systems. We also need a way to control multi-threaded access to the process through the public API when it is running. For example it isn't a good idea to try and get stack frames while the process is running. To implement this, the lldb_private::Process class now contains a ReadWriteLock member variable named m_run_lock which is used to control the public process state. The public process state represents the state of the process as the client knows it. The private is used to control the actual current process state. So the public state of the process can be stopped, yet the private state can be running when evaluating an expression for example. Adding the read/write lock where readers are clients that want the process to stay stopped, and writers are clients that run the process, allows us to accurately control multi-threaded access to the process. Switched the SBThread and SBFrame over to us shared pointers to the ExecutionContextRef class instead of making their own class to track this. This fixed an issue with assigning on SBFrame to another and will also centralize the code that tracks weak references to execution context objects into one location. git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/lldb/trunk@154099 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8",C++

To implement this, the lldb_private::Process class now contains a ReadWriteLock member variable named m_run_lock which is used to control the public process state. The public process state represents the state of the process as the client knows it. The private is used to control the actual current process state. So the public state of the process can be stopped, yet the private state can be running when evaluating an expression for example. Adding the read/write lock where readers are clients that want the process to stay stopped, and writers are clients that run the process, allows us to accurately control multi-threaded access to the process. Switched the SBThread and SBFrame over to us shared pointers to the ExecutionContextRef class instead of making their own class to track this. This fixed an issue with assigning on SBFrame to another and will also centralize the code that tracks weak references to execution context objects into one location.",C++

"Fixed some things, added new algorithms and updated the documentation. 1. Improved ip_filter_linear and ip_filter_linear_float to take a parameter that specifies how border pixels are dealt with. Sometimes we need them to stay black and other times we want them to take the values from the original image. 2. Fixed a bug in Canny edge detector, it was not handling diagonal lines properly. Before: http://postimage.org/image/6hiho8qqt/ After : http://postimage.org/image/dsjbu5iv1/ 3. Implemented a line drawing algorithm that can draw lines specified in Hessian form or if two endpoints are given. I wrote also a function to extract endpoints from a line in Hessian form. 4. Implemented Hough Transform for line detection. You can check it out in the documentation. 5. Implemeneted morphological operations such as dilation, erosion, opening and closing. For now, they work on binary images but I will generalize them for grayscale and RGB images later. I also implemented a boundary extraction operation which can be called from command line: oiiotool --morph_outline 1 input.tif -o output.tif or you can combine image processing operations to achieve the same effect: oiiotool input.tif --morph_erode 1 --invert input.tif --set_intersect -o output.tif This can be done thanks to the image stack already present in oiio. 6. Implemented set operations for binary images such as union, intersection and difference. 7. Implemented a logical operation XOR for binary images. Download test images and documentation: http://www.mediafire.com/?d8d89k7i8m7e0b7 Final note: I will stop adding new functionality now, from now on I will work ONLY on getting all this code approved. I just wanted to add these things since I planned so from the start, and to close a milestone. Thanks for any feedback, Stefan",C++

For example it isn't a good idea to try and get stack frames while the process is running. To implement this, the lldb_private::Process class now contains a ReadWriteLock member variable named m_run_lock which is used to control the public process state. The public process state represents the state of the process as the client knows it. The private is used to control the actual current process state. So the public state of the process can be stopped, yet the private state can be running when evaluating an expression for example. Adding the read/write lock where readers are clients that want the process to stay stopped, and writers are clients that run the process, allows us to accurately control multi-threaded access to the process. Switched the SBThread and SBFrame over to us shared pointers to the ExecutionContextRef class instead of making their own class to track this. This fixed an issue with assigning on SBFrame to another and will also centralize the code that tracks weak references to execution context objects into one location. git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/lldb/trunk@154099 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8",C++

"Keymap changes from recent activity. No AltGr yet. Below is a mostly complete summary of the changes in this commit. * Set the DeadKeys for the US-International Keymap to use the Option map. * Rename American keymap to US * Update the US, US-International, and United-Kingdom keymaps to take out unneeded spaces in the option layer. Also updated the dead keys and some other keys on the US-International keyboard to use UTF-8 characters rather than there ASCII equivalents when different. * Make the Option key fall-through when there is no mapping in the Option table. Option is for special characters, if none, print the regular one. This is mostly meant for the US keymap which has an empty option map. But also so that you don't have to repeat the normal, shift, and caps maps in the option map needlessly. Although the keymaps are still not empty in some cases that it could be like numpad keys and space. * Update the /bin/keymap app to use fputs() instead of printf() when there is no actual formatting taking place. I've gotten into trouble for doing this before and it is faster to not process the string unnecessarily. * Also several 80-char limit style fixes and updated comments. * In Keymap class Reorder the modifier keys to match the keymap files. Put B_CONTROL_KEY check above B_OPTION_KEY. Neither change has any effect, they are purely aesthetic. * Update DumpKeymap() method to use the abbreviated modifier letters so it will fit in your 80-char wide terminal. * Tiny style fix in InputServer * 80-char limit style fix in BWindow and add a comment that the shortcut gets eaten in the case of Cmd+Q * Implement IndexForModifier() in KeyboardLayout, although I am not using it. * Take Caps Lock out of the Modifier keys window because I couldn't get it to work the way I wanted it to. * Move key roles to the left column, and the key label on the left. Add column header labels. Thanks Rimas! * Add validation and improve marking menu options. Add a 'Disabled' option to control, option, and command menus to disable the key. Make the key role text grey if the key roles is disabled. Validation ensures that you cannot repeat the same key twice in the Modifier keys window since that won't work. You can't define 2 sets of option keys even if you really want to. You can disable your control, option, and command keys if you want, but that is not recommended. * Rename kUpdateModifiers to kUpdateModifierKeys message to differetiate it from kUpdateModifier. * Add shift key to Modifier keys window, use the stop icon instead of the warning icon to indicate conflicts. * Allow the Layout system to control the size of the Modifier keys window again, set the width's of the key role lables to the widest, set the width of the menu fields to take up the rest of the space minus room for the conflict views. I didn't like it that the Modifier keys window would change size based on what options you had selected in the menu fields. Now it doesn't, but, the layout system still makes it all fit.",C

"* Slideshow slots now have 'ui' and 'limit' options. If 'ui' is false (it defaults to true), there are no slideshow arrows and no javascript is run for the slideshow. If 'limit' is not null, the slideshow displays no more than that number of images (useful for creating thumbnails of slideshows). The 'firstOnly' option is still available and implies both 'ui' => false and 'limit' => 1. * When a slideshow is initialized, the first slideshow item is displayed by calling showItem(0, 0) for consistency. This ensures that the logic that updates the height of the outer divs is actually called. * In addition to setting the height of the slideshow ul element to the height of the current item, showItem() now also sets the height of the .a-slideshow-view div. Without this controls are not correctly positioned if the slideshow ul element is floated and the buttons get stuck at the top * A big one: the code that updates the height of the containing divs doesn't work if the image isn't loaded yet (at least to the point of knowing its size). This logic has been updated to check the 'complete' property of the image and, if it is not set, to retry the showItem() call in 100ms. This fixes a number of unpredictable ""hey, why is my slideshow crushing the stuff below it some of the time"" situations git-svn-id: http://svn.apostrophenow.org/plugins/apostrophePlugin/branches/1.5@4693 c89fab08-2f9b-42bf-8176-bd3ad6bee547",JavaScript

I've found myself using `issers` a handful of times just to make an interface play nice with the form component, but the code reads funny now. I don't think we should be accounting for every possible `getter` variation, but I think this one is common enough that it warrants a discussion. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- by fabpot at 2012-03-11T08:25:31Z I tend to agree with with. What do you think @bschussek? --------------------------------------------------------------------------- by kriswallsmith at 2012-03-16T22:42:28Z I'm not so sure. There are lots of reasons to write a *hasser* that accepts an argument (i.e. `User::hasRole($role)`). Doesn't seem as clean as *issers* and *getters*. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- by vicb at 2012-03-16T22:49:14Z > There are lots of reasons to write a hasser that accepts an argument May be can check for 0 args as we are already using reflexion ? --------------------------------------------------------------------------- by kriswallsmith at 2012-03-16T22:55:43Z In that case we should check that there are either 0 arguments or only optional arguments and also consider adding the same logic to the other varieties. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- by jjbohn at 2012-03-16T23:37:47Z Passing arguments seems like a pretty big departure for PropertyPath. How would you annotate that? I'm not sure I see a common use case for needing arguments when mapping data to and from forms. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- by stof at 2012-03-16T23:50:22Z @jjbohn it is not about passing arguments but about using the hasser only if it does not have required arguments --------------------------------------------------------------------------- by jjbohn at 2012-03-17T01:54:18Z Ah. I see. I have a tendency to read @kriswallsmith comments wrong :D. I could see that but iirc, there's not any current check like this on the other accessors. Happy to add it though if there's a consensus. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- by fabpot at 2012-03-17T11:24:34Z What's the point is checking the hasser/getter/isser arguments. It's up to the developer to check if he can use them or not. Let's not complexify the code for this. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- by kriswallsmith at 2012-03-17T15:37:39Z My concern is that someone writes a hasser method on their model that is not intended for use with the form component but it's called anyway, leading to WTFs. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- by stof at 2012-04-03T22:28:21Z @fabpot what's your decision about this ? @jjbohn you need to rebase your PR.

"[configs/releng] Add UEFI boot support via Linux >= 3.3 EFI boot stub on x86_64 Makes an efiboot.img (FAT16) for ""El Torito"" (additional).

Sequel used to modify the connection objects to give them a per-connection hash of native prepared statements, because that's how Sequel works on other adapters. However, because JRuby 2.0 will make object proxy caching opt-in, you either have to manually set __persistent__ = true for each connection object class, or you have to not modify that class. Since java object proxy caching apparently hurts performance (which is the reason they want to make it opt-in), switch to using a single hash in the Database object, keyed by connection (protected by a mutex for thread-safety).",Ruby

"Fix Qt sometimes unintentionally using LLVM. Moved setting ENV['LD'] = ENV['CXX'] to after ENV.llvm is (possibly) set. Otherwise ENV['LD'] might end up as llvm-gcc rather than the expected CXX version. Verified that this fixed the issue I had installing QT on my machine. Fixes issue #11202. See also #11198. By the comment above where ENV.llvm is set, maybe it was supposed to be using clang rather than llvm-gcc though because my Xcode is 3.2.6. clang is ""Apple clang version 1.7 (tags/Apple/clang-77) (based on LLVM 2.9svn)"", and llvm-gcc is ""i686-apple-darwin10-llvm-gcc-4.2 (GCC) 4.2.1 (Based on Apple Inc. build 5658) (LLVM build 2335.6)"".

"Use the type of the actual return value in @MVC The new @MVC support classes select a HandlerMethodArgumentResolver and a HandlerMethodReturnValueHandler statically, i.e. based on the signature of the method, which means that a controller method can't declare a more general return type like Object but actually return a more specific one, e.g. String vs RedirectView, and expect the right handler to be used. The fix ensures that a HandlerMethodReturnValueHandler is selected based on the actual return value type, which is something that was supported with the old @MVC support classes. One consequence of the change is the selected HandlerMethodReturnValueHandler can no longer be cached but that matches the behavior of the old @MVC support classes. Issues: SPR-9218",Java

"Retina, iCloud, and ARC updates Some of the highlights... General: - Now requires Xcode 4.3. - Started migrating towards ARC. Not all the way there yet. OmniUI: - Removed unused images - Added @2x image variants - Added OUIEmptyPaddingInspectorSlice for pushing some slices to the bottom of an inspector - Added custom keyboard support to OUIInspectorTextWell - Replaced OUIAlertView with OUIAlert - Added some accessibility support; more to do - Finished conflict resolution UI and support - Finished iCloud configuration UI and migration of files - Finished support for notification of incoming deletes of open documents - Automatically close documents when reverting fails (due to the file being deleted while the app is in the background) - Fixed issues with preview generation while documents are being moved, deleted, updated (delay the writer block until we are done). - Added support for rendering previews of conflict versions - Added support for updating OUIDocument's references to attachments after being informed of a move by NSFilePresenter - Added Retina-awareness to preview generation - Added Retina-awareness to icon selection for import/export pane - Added support for badging files that are not on iCloud when iCloud is enabled - Improved the performance of opening/closing documents - Fixed a few edge cases of document renaming cancellation - Fixed parent view calcuation for OUIEditableFrame's controls. - Added support for locking interaction on the document, but letting alerts still have user interaction enabled - Don't open conflicted/not downloaded document on launch - Added top-level Omni Sync Server item to import/export OmniFileStore: - Added support for migrating documents into/out of the ubiquity scope. - Added support for resolving conflicts. - Added support for automatically downloading small documents when on Wi-Fi - Reduce the number of redundant scan operations - Add support for informing the OFSFileStore delegate of move/copy operations (used to update preview cache w/o rebuilding them). - Properly deal with iCloud asking us to relinquishing to writer. This is complicated. Response to changes is buffered until we reacquire or processed immediately if we aren't in a writer block. - A bunch of other iCloud bug workarounds, and cleanup - Add file item support for tracking whether an instance is in iCloud and whether a download has been requested (even if it hasn't started). - Disable ubiquity support on iOS if the device is not running 5.1 or later Configurations: - Code signing updates - Enable GCC_WARN_ABOUT_DEPRECATED_FUNCTIONS and CLANG_WARN_DEPRECATED_OBJC_IMPLEMENTATIONS - Add notes next to a few other new warnings about why they aren't on yet Scripts: - Run Xcode's pngcrush on iOS when copying library resources - OmniRunUnitTests handled more configurations - Added Scripts/rubylib/xcodeproj.rb, a simple helper for dealing with Xcode projects OmniBase: - Added ARC helper macros, OB_STRONG, OB_BRIDGE, and OB_AUTORELEASING - Added OB_FOR_IN - Added OBASSERT_IF - Added some unit tests OmniFoundation: - Turned off GC support, but not all the code is removed. - Made the public header ARC safe - Updated OFUTI to service more requests out of our local plist instead of trusting LaunchServices (which will return crazy info from other apps) - Made OFBindingPoint an object instead of a struct, for ARC - Made a few other classes ARC compatible - Add -[NSProcessInfo isSandboxed] OmniAppKit: - Removed implementations of deprecated methods - Declare some used methods as API (moving towards enabling -Wselector) - Removed implementation of deprecated drag source method from OADragController and the delegate (no longer used). - Reeanbled OA_USE_COLOR_MANAGER for now. Still need to find a replacement. - Removed duplicate implementation of quarantine extensions - Remove NSTableView(OAExtensions) -tableView:draggingSourceOperationMaskForLocal: hack. Use the public API. OmniQuartz - Added very basic performance logging for -renderInContext:. - Enable -[CALayer(OQExtensions) renderInContextIgnoringCache:] on iOS TextEditor: - Removed the Midsummer.rtf sample for now.

"ARM: dma-mapping: fix array out of bound access in __dma_*_remap Let consider off = (PTRS_PER_PTE - 1); idx = CONSISTENT_PTE_INDEX(c->vm_start); provide us with last vaild element in consistent_pte[]; Also __dma_alloc_remap() request 1 page, i.e size == PAGE_SIZE. Because size, off, idx are vaild values with respect to consistent mapping region, and its a do{}while loop, so it will exit loop after first pass. All fine But their is a catch, we do off++, so do{ do_all_important_stuff off++; >>>>> now off = PTRS_PER_PTE if (off >= PTRS_PER_PTE) { >>>>>> condition TRUE off = 0; pte = consistent_pte[++idx]; >>>>> we did idx++ but idx was already pointing to last element, so we are trying to access array out of bound } } while (size -= PAGE_SIZE);>>>>>>> conditon FALSE, but its too late The proposed solution, move if body from last to begining of do{}while. In this case we will prevent out of bound acess, without effecting the flow on first entry and also exit from do{}while loop. Moving the if body to begining of do{}while ensured that on first entry to do{}while loop, the if condition fails hence not effecting the first entry condition. on subsequent iterations of do{}while loop the while condition will be checked before we execute the if conditon. Given functions __dma_alloc_remap()/ __dma_free_remap() already haves necessary checks to ensure that size is valid, so again if we analyse from given example do{ if (off >= PTRS_PER_PTE) { >>>>>> condition FALSE off = 0; pte = consistent_pte[++idx]; >>>>>> we avoid this } do_all_important_stuff off++; >>>>>> now off = PTRS_PER_PTE } while (size -= PAGE_SIZE); >>>>>>> condition FAILS, we exit the do{}while, effectively prevented the out of bound access of consistent_pte[] NOTE: size is valid, so in proposed solution while conditon is effectively preventing the out of bound array access to occur. If we review the code from normal access point of view, we are not changing any flow logic, also after the exit from do{}while no access to off, idx, pte is performed by the function. So we do not need to worry about post do{}while statments Backported to 2.6.32.9 by adridu59 Signed-off-by: Naveen Yadav <yad.naveen at gmail.com> Signed-off-by: Ajeet Yadav <ajeet.yadav.77 at gmail.com> Signed-off-by: Adrien TÃ©tar <adrien.tetar@hotmail.fr>",C

Rearranged dir structure of the site. Moved pages that comprise the primary component of the site into the root GIVECenter/ directory. Moved all images into GIVECenter/img/ directory and all Javascript files into GIVECenter/js/ directory. Updated pages that require those to refer to the correct path. Fixed several bugs in several of the scripts. MySQLDatabaseConn.php now correctly suppresses all automatic system alerts in the event that mysql_connect() fails. Error messages from mysql_connect() failing are still available in the resulting exception objects.,PHP
"Improved output text; Removed duplication; Improved OO; Refactored... Refactored location classes into separate files (from rnib-location.js into location/*). Created Location, Way, Place, POI, Address and FindResults classes/files. Improved OO for distance checking so classes Location and Way answer ""closest to point"" question. Reformatted output text (i.e. speech) to be more natural. Introduced FindResults (rather than attaching POIs to Locations) including ability to remove closestPlace from POIs (by...) Added equals() method to Location and Way and poiPlaceMatches() that uses those to POI (& mock-based tests for all). Corrected GeoCodeCalc.toClock() to allow +/- 15 degrees (rather than everything within hour). Tweaked tests' use of asynchronicity to be deterministic (switched from one waitsFor() to each using whenLoadedIt()).",JavaScript

Fixup tests to work on CentOS 5 Several tests were failing because the depended on being able to find a user provider. On CentOS 5 this didn't work because the provider that should be used (the useradd provider) is not considered suitable when it gets run as a non-privaleged user because the useradd and related commands are not executable. The user_spec.rb and group_spec.rb test didn't need the tests that were failing because they were testing functionality that is already tested by the Type base class's own tests. The ral_spec.rb needed more mocking of the things it was using in order to abstract it from the system on which it is running. The resources_spec.rb got a small cleanup and was fixed by reordering the data loading in Puppet::Type::Resources so that it doesn't load information about a user until it needs to.

"Better updating of cached git sources. Make sure to hard-reset to get rid of any potential problems from a previous run. This should clear the way for using checkout safely. Do not merge remote branches into local branches. Instead, just fetch all branches and tags from the remote and just keep the branches as mere remote branches. Checkout the SHA directly. No need to open concerns about checking out branches that could possibly be updated. In the case of a branch being specified on the source, this requires looking up the SHA for the remote branch, rather than for the local branch, because remote branches are not merged into local branches. In the case of a tag or SHA being specified on the source, such a lookup appears unnecessary. Fixes #44. Fixes #49. Thanks @TylerRick and @bradmontgomery.

"Fisher Price Deskbar icon support Implements the feature described in #7132 Also fixes #2387 (menu items too big in horizontal mode when font size > 12) Adds a slider to Deskbar preferences which allows you to resize your Deskbar team icons from 16x16 to 96x96. The default is 16x16. This works both in vertical and horizontal mode. In vertical mode when icon sizes are greater than 32x32 the label moves underneath the icon where there is more room. In horizontal mode the width of the menu item increases to make room for the icon while keeping room for the label the same. As many applications are added the labels are truncated as usual. This patch also adds a checkbox to the Deskbar preferences to hide application names to make more room for icons if you wish. It doesn't make a lot of sense at 16x16 but does >32x32. If the kResizeTeamIcons message gets dropped, don't resize to current value, just do nothing. This fixes a bug where sometimes the slider wouldn't trigger a resize. Fix a spelling error in a comment.

Fixes #910: Change MODIFY to CHANGE when changing a table name and ommit the table name when not changing it. Signed-off-by: Frank de Jonge <info@frenky.net>,PHP
"Functional changes: - add a write_paper_packet_to_blocks() and ancillary items for packet format 2. - new routine initialize_block(). - tweaks to manage_active_blocks() - careful, this need to be checked, tested, and maybe tweaked some more. - calculate starting address at the beginning and increment, rather than use subscripts for each move in unpack_samples(). We should redefine paper_input_input_t to be in sane accordance with this change. Stuff useful for testing: - new routine print_block_info(). - new routine print_ring_mcnts(). - timing test mode - this is bits of code enabled by #define TIMING_TEST. When in this mode, we do not wait for packets on the network, but rather loop as fast as we can through calls to write_paper_packet_to_blocks(), aka ""the unpacker"", a specific number of times. The packets sent to the unpacker contain completely bogus data, but the header fields (mcnt, etc) are fixed up to be as one would expect them to be. One can then use the linux time command to arrive at the speed of the unpacker, assuming the unpacker is taking virtually all of the execution time.",Matlab

"Fixed signed integer overflows in timer code (ticket #145). Integer overflow is undefined behaviour in C and this indeed caused problems on Solaris/SPARC (at least in some cases). Fix is to subtract unsigned integers instead, and then cast result to a signed one, which is implementation-defined behaviour and used to work. Strictly speaking, we should compare (unsigned) result with the maximum value of the corresponding signed integer type instead, this will be defined behaviour. This will require much more changes though, and considered to be overkill for now.",C

"merged branch jjbohn/feature/property-path-hasser (PR #3549) Commits ------- b6ac1aa [FORM] Give PropertyPath ability to read hassers Discussion ---------- [Form] Give PropertyPath ability to read hassers Bug fix: no Feature addition: yes Backwards compatibility break: no Symfony2 tests pass: yes Fixes the following tickets: - Todo: - Using a `hasser` instead of `isser` for Boolean values is pretty common. I've found myself using `issers` a handful of times just to make an interface play nice with the form component, but the code reads funny now. I don't think we should be accounting for every possible `getter` variation, but I think this one is common enough that it warrants a discussion. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- by fabpot at 2012-03-11T08:25:31Z I tend to agree with with. What do you think @bschussek? --------------------------------------------------------------------------- by kriswallsmith at 2012-03-16T22:42:28Z I'm not so sure. There are lots of reasons to write a *hasser* that accepts an argument (i.e. `User::hasRole($role)`). Doesn't seem as clean as *issers* and *getters*. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- by vicb at 2012-03-16T22:49:14Z > There are lots of reasons to write a hasser that accepts an argument May be can check for 0 args as we are already using reflexion ? --------------------------------------------------------------------------- by kriswallsmith at 2012-03-16T22:55:43Z In that case we should check that there are either 0 arguments or only optional arguments and also consider adding the same logic to the other varieties. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- by jjbohn at 2012-03-16T23:37:47Z Passing arguments seems like a pretty big departure for PropertyPath. How would you annotate that? I'm not sure I see a common use case for needing arguments when mapping data to and from forms. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- by stof at 2012-03-16T23:50:22Z @jjbohn it is not about passing arguments but about using the hasser only if it does not have required arguments --------------------------------------------------------------------------- by jjbohn at 2012-03-17T01:54:18Z Ah. I see. I have a tendency to read @kriswallsmith comments wrong :D. I could see that but iirc, there's not any current check like this on the other accessors. Happy to add it though if there's a consensus. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- by fabpot at 2012-03-17T11:24:34Z What's the point is checking the hasser/getter/isser arguments. It's up to the developer to check if he can use them or not. Let's not complexify the code for this. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- by kriswallsmith at 2012-03-17T15:37:39Z My concern is that someone writes a hasser method on their model that is not intended for use with the form component but it's called anyway, leading to WTFs. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- by stof at 2012-04-03T22:28:21Z @fabpot what's your decision about this ? @jjbohn you need to rebase your PR. It conflicts with master as tests have been moved --------------------------------------------------------------------------- by bschussek at 2012-04-05T14:53:55Z @kriswallsmith is right. The check for 1 === $method->getNumberOfRequiredParameters() can (and should) easily be added to all of the if-clauses here. Apart from that, I'm okay with adding this.",PHP

"Fix several problems with protected access control: - The [class.protected] restriction is non-trivial for any instance member, even if the access lacks an object (for example, if it's a pointer-to-member constant). In this case, it is equivalent to requiring the naming class to equal the context class. - The [class.protected] restriction applies to accesses to constructors and destructors. A protected constructor or destructor can only be used to create or destroy a base subobject, as a direct result. - Several places were dropping or misapplying object information. The standard could really be much clearer about what the object type is supposed to be in some of these accesses. Usually it's easy enough to find a reasonable answer, but still, the standard makes a very confident statement about accesses to instance members only being possible in either pointer-to-member literals or member access expressions, which just completely ignores concepts like constructor and destructor calls, using declarations, unevaluated field references, etc. git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/cfe/trunk@154248 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8",C++

"block: Limit deafult readahead size for small devices. Linus reports a _really_ small & slow (505kB, 15kB/s) USB device, on which blkid runs unpleasantly slow. He manages to optimize the blkid reads down to 1kB+16kB, but still kernel read-ahead turns it into 48kB. lseek 0, read 1024 => readahead 4 pages (start of file) lseek 1536, read 16384 => readahead 8 pages (page contiguous) The readahead heuristics involved here are reasonable ones in general. So it's good to fix blkid with fadvise(RANDOM), as Linus already did. For the kernel part, Linus suggests: So maybe we could be less aggressive about read-ahead when the size of the device is small? Turning a 16kB read into a 64kB one is a big deal, when it's about 15% of the whole device! This looks reasonable: smaller device tend to be slower (USB sticks as well as micro/mobile/old hard disks). Given that the non-rotational attribute is not always reported, we can take disk size as a max readahead size hint. This patch uses a formula that generates the following concrete limits: disk size readahead size (scale by 4) (scale by 2) 1M 8k 4M 16k 16M 32k 64M 64k 256M 128k --------------------------- (*) 1G 256k 4G 512k 16G 1024k 64G 2048k 256G 4096k (*) Since the default readahead size is 128k, this limit only takes effect for devices whose size is less than 256M. The formula is determined on the following data, collected by script: #!/bin/sh # please make sure BDEV is not mounted or opened by others BDEV=sdb for rasize in 4 16 32 64 128 256 512 1024 2048 4096 8192 do echo $rasize > /sys/block/$BDEV/queue/read_ahead_kb time dd if=/dev/$BDEV of=/dev/null bs=4k count=102400 done The principle is, the formula shall not limit readahead size to such a degree that will impact some device's sequential read performance. The Intel SSD is special in that its throughput increases steadily with larger readahead size. However it may take years for Linux to increase its default readahead size to 2MB, so we don't take it seriously in the formula.

"Fixed tests failing on timezone abbreviations. Before my last commit, I did not run my tests. Tests failed. I blocked out some tests in `t/format/offset.t`. Some of these tests are new tests. They use Amsterdam as a timezone. I was under the impression from a combination of my reading any my faulty memory that Amsterdam had some strange, down to the second timezone offset that occurred after the adoption of standard time. Nope. Amsterdam did have surprised, though. Amsterdam does have clock transitions that occur at standard time. Plus, I encountered the issue of rule sets whose first entry begins after the time at which the rule set is applied, implying no daylight savings time rule in effect, or standard time. I'll revisit Amsterdam after the clock transition table is implemented. I fixed the tests in `t/math` that were defeated by the timezone abbreviation. Previously, the timezone abbreviation return was always `UTC`, because timezone abbreviations had not yet been implemented. Now the correct timezone abbreviations are being returned. It is the test that is the failure. I heap scorn upon it. In anticipation of future scorn heaping upon yours truly, let me confess that these tests that failed on the timezone abbreviation are only passing because I changed the expected output to match the actual output, without taking the time to reason about whether the actual output is correct. I'll let you hate for two minutes before I continue. Now, if you've recovered from that, let me explain. You see, I am working on a far more thorough test for timezone offsets. One where I take a list of every clock transition in the Olson files and compare the logic of my timezone library against the output of GNU date for the second of every the clock transition, and the second before every the clock transition. Rather than fuss about these tests, I'd rather spend my time working on this new test.",JavaScript

"Fixed tests failing on timezone abbreviations. Before my last commit, I did not run my tests. Tests failed. I blocked out some tests in `t/format/offset.t`. Some of these tests are new tests. They use Amsterdam as a timezone. I was under the impression from a combination of my reading any my faulty memory that Amsterdam had some strange, down to the second timezone offset that occurred after the adoption of standard time. Nope. Amsterdam did have surprised, though. Amsterdam does have clock transitions that occur at standard time. Plus, I encountered the issue of rule sets whose first entry begins after the time at which the rule set is applied, implying no daylight savings time rule in effect, or standard time. I'll revisit Amsterdam after the clock transition table is implemented. I fixed the tests in `t/math` that were defeated by the timezone abbreviation. Previously, the timezone abbreviation return was always `UTC`, because timezone abbreviations had not yet been implemented. Now the correct timezone abbreviations are being returned. It is the test that is the failure. I heap scorn upon it. In anticipation of future scorn heaping upon yours truly, let me confess that these tests that failed on the timezone abbreviation are only passing because I changed the expected output to match the actual output, without taking the time to reason about whether the actual output is correct. I'll let you hate for two minutes before I continue. Now, if you've recovered from that, let me explain. You see, I am working on a far more thorough test for timezone offsets. One where I take a list of every clock transition in the Olson files and compare the logic of my timezone library against the output of GNU date for the second of every the clock transition, and the second before every the clock transition. Rather than fuss about these tests, I'd rather spend my time working on this new test.",JavaScript

"hugetlbfs: remove unregister_filesystem() when initializing module It was introduced by d1d5e05ffdc1 (""hugetlbfs: return error code when initializing module"") but as Al pointed out, is a bad idea. Quoted comments from Al: ""Note that unregister_filesystem() in module init is *always* wrong; it's not an issue here (it's done too early to care about and realistically the box is not going anywhere - it'll panic when attempt to exec /sbin/init fails, if not earlier), but it's a damn bad example. Consider a normal fs module. Somebody loads it and in parallel with that we get a mount attempt on that fs type. It comes between register and failure exits that causes unregister; at that point we are screwed since grabbing a reference to module as done by mount is enough to prevent exit, but not to prevent the failure of init. As the result, module will get freed when init fails, mounted fs of that type be damned."" So remove it.

"Fixed a problem that prevents Ruby backtrace from showing up in Java exception tree. The Throwable class is somewhat broken in that it is really not designed to enable lazy computation of stack trace elements. Where this can be seen most clearly is the way nested exceptions are printed. This is done in ThrowableprintStackTraceAsCause(...) method that doesn't allow any overriding, and this internally uses getOurStackTrace(), not getStackTrace(). RaiseException tries to work around this problem by overriding various printStackTrace and call this.getStackTrace() to lazy compute them, but because of the above, when RaiseException is nested inside another exception 'x' and x.printStackTrace() is invoked, it fails to provide the proper stack trace. Really the only reliable way to make it work is to eagerly fill in a stack trace. This change provides that. Signed-off-by: Charles Oliver Nutter <headius@headius.com>",Ruby

"debian: Fix the squeeze->wheezy install-remove-install upgrade When one installed syslog-ng in squeeze, and removed it, then dist-upgrades to wheezy, and tries to install syslog-ng again, it won't automatically work, because the logrotate script was moved from syslog-ng to syslog-ng-core, and the preinst wasn't clever enough to deal with this situation. The way to solve this is to move the .disabled file back to its place under the following conditions (assuming the postinst is called with 'install' as its first parameter, and the .disabled file exists): * It's either an install when there was a former syslog-ng-core version. * Or it's an install where there was no former syslog-ng-core installation, and the destination file doesn't exist yet. This supports both the install-remove-install case that span squeeze->wheezy, and works even between wheezy->wheezy versions.

"misc/kdeutils3: Fix PR#46302 (DragonFly) The problem with this package is that the configure step is insufficient at determining if the math long double functions are supported. It tests for a couple of functions and assumes that if those test pass, then all ""L"" functions are supported. When DragonFly recently upgraded its math library by adding support for a number of long double functions, this package started failing. Support for expl, logl, log10l, sinhl, tanhl, acoshl, asinhl, atanhl, and coshl are still missing on *all* BSDs. The fix for the package is to override the configure script by falsely stating that long double is not supported. Only kcalc uses long double so this misconfiguration only has the effect to cause kcalc to use the standard double math functions. FreeBSD almost definitely needs the same Makefile fix. No revbump is needed because pre-libm improved DragonFly releases are configured the same way.",C

"Windows: Add per object per user EACCES caching If a cache manager is told by a file server that the user does not have permission to fetch status for an object, the cache manager must avoid requesting a fetch status a second time for that object for the same user. Doing so risks triggering the rx call abort throttling which can have a significant impact on end user usability of the Explorer Shell and other applications. The cache manager cannot make a decision on whether or not to issue an RXAFS_FetchStatus RPC based upon the type of the object because the type is unknown to the cache manager. A file server will succeed a FetchStatus request when the parent directory ACL grants lookup permission if the object in question is the directory or is a symlink/mountpoint. Only file objects require read/write permissions to obtain status information. The rx call abort throttling is broken is many ways and must be avoided. Call aborts are tracked by call channel and occur whenever ten call aborts are issued on the same call channel in a row regardless of the amount of time that has elapsed. The EACCES cache works by storing EACCES events by the FID and User for which the event occurred, when it occurred and the FID of the parent directory. By definition, the parent FID of a volume root directory is itself. Entries are removed from the cache under the following circumstances: 1. When the parent FID's callback expires or is replaced. 2. When the parent FID's cm_scache object is recycled. 3. When the user's tokens expire or are replaced. Entries are not removed when the FID's cm_scache object is recycled. This patchset also implements correct behavior if the VLF_DFSFILESET flag is set on a volume.

"Let the caller handle send errors For the moment, ignore any send errors in both directions. Error messages are printed to the shell if there is an error (badmatch). Likely the caller wants the tunnel to stay up for transient issues, for example if the interface goes down ({error,enetunreach}) and might come up again. In the case of fatal issues (bad fd, ...), we should shutdown the tunnel. There are 2 problems: * the message flow will not be in one direction, e.g., socket -> filter -> tun Instead the filter would call into the socket/tun and shut down the gen_server killing the tunnel. This makes the system hard to understand. * tuncer:send/2 is a wrapper around erlang:port_command/2. Not sure what values it returns. The documentation says badarg. tuncer wraps the port_command in a try/catch and returns an error tuple. gen_udp:send returns {error, posix()}. tuncer should do the same.",Erlang

"arm: Fix cpu_proc_fin() for proc-v7.S and make kexec work The comments in arm_machine_restart() suggest that cpu_proc_fin() will clean and disable cache and turn off interrupts. This does not seem to be implemented for proc-v7.S, implement it the same way as for proc-v6.S. This also makes kexec work for v7. Note that a related TLB and branch traget flush patch is also needed to avoid kexec ""crc error"". Note that there are still some issues that seem to be related to L2 cache being on and causing occasional uncompress ""crc error"" with kexec. Anyways, this gets kexec mostly working on V7 for now.

"Fix using Clang as a cross compiler installed on a host machine and not inside of a sysroot targeting a system+sysroot which is ""similar"" or ""compatible"" with the host system. This shows up when trying to build system images on largely compatible hardware as-if fully cross compiled. The problem is that previously we *perfectly* mimiced GCC here, and it turns out GCC has a bug that no one has really stumbled across. GCC will try to look in thy system prefix ('/usr/local' f.ex.) into which it is instaled to find libraries installed along side GCC that should be preferred to the base system libraries ('/usr' f.ex.). This seems not unreasonable, but it has a very unfortunate consequence when combined with a '--sysroot' which does *not* contain the GCC installation we're using to complete the toolchain. That results in some of the host system's library directories being searched during the link. Now, it so happens that most folks doing stuff like this use '--with-sysroot' and '--disable-multilib' when configuring GCC. Even better, they're usually not cross-compiling to a target that is similar to the host. As a result, searching the host for libraries doesn't really matter -- most of the time weird directories get appended that don't exist (no arm triple lib directory, etc). Even if you're cross-compiling from 32-bit to 64-bit x86 or vice-versa, disabling multilib makes it less likely that you'll actually find viable libraries on the host. But that's just luck. We shouldn't rely on this, and this patch disables looking in the system prefix containing the GCC installation if that system prefix is *outside* of the sysroot. For empty sysroots, this has no effect. Similarly, when using the GCC *inside* of the sysroot, we still track wherever it is installed within the sysroot and look there for libraries. But now we can use a cross compiler GCC installation outside the system root, and only look for the crtbegin.o in the GCC installation, and look for all the other libraries inside the system root.

"[TablesAndCellStyles] Reuse View instances in Home_Adapter. Home_Adapter.GetView() was creating a new View instance every time it was invoked without trying to reuse the `convertView` parameter. The result: excessive gref use if you scrolled a lot, eventualy resulting in app death on the emulator. There are two potential fixes: 1. Call GC.Collect() to collect all the unused instances. 2. Do this ""properly"", in the style of the LabelledSections sample. Of course we do (2). ;-) This involves changing Home_Adapter.GetView() to work in terms of separate ArrayAdapter instances (one for section headers, one for each section), in the style of LabelledSections, and also requires overriding BaseAdapter.ViewTypeCount and BaseAdapter.GetItemViewType() (or things crash). Unrelated, I also moved the `samples` initialization into the static constructor so that it wouldn't be repeated every time Home_Adapter is instantiated (e.g. on screen rotation). This is fine as it doesn't reference any Context instances.",C#

"merged branch jjbohn/feature/property-path-hasser (PR #3549) Commits ------- b6ac1aa [FORM] Give PropertyPath ability to read hassers Discussion ---------- [Form] Give PropertyPath ability to read hassers Bug fix: no Feature addition: yes Backwards compatibility break: no Symfony2 tests pass: yes Fixes the following tickets: - Todo: - Using a `hasser` instead of `isser` for Boolean values is pretty common. I've found myself using `issers` a handful of times just to make an interface play nice with the form component, but the code reads funny now. I don't think we should be accounting for every possible `getter` variation, but I think this one is common enough that it warrants a discussion. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- by fabpot at 2012-03-11T08:25:31Z I tend to agree with with. What do you think @bschussek? --------------------------------------------------------------------------- by kriswallsmith at 2012-03-16T22:42:28Z I'm not so sure. There are lots of reasons to write a *hasser* that accepts an argument (i.e. `User::hasRole($role)`). Doesn't seem as clean as *issers* and *getters*. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- by vicb at 2012-03-16T22:49:14Z > There are lots of reasons to write a hasser that accepts an argument May be can check for 0 args as we are already using reflexion ? --------------------------------------------------------------------------- by kriswallsmith at 2012-03-16T22:55:43Z In that case we should check that there are either 0 arguments or only optional arguments and also consider adding the same logic to the other varieties. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- by jjbohn at 2012-03-16T23:37:47Z Passing arguments seems like a pretty big departure for PropertyPath. How would you annotate that? I'm not sure I see a common use case for needing arguments when mapping data to and from forms. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- by stof at 2012-03-16T23:50:22Z @jjbohn it is not about passing arguments but about using the hasser only if it does not have required arguments --------------------------------------------------------------------------- by jjbohn at 2012-03-17T01:54:18Z Ah. I see. I have a tendency to read @kriswallsmith comments wrong :D. I could see that but iirc, there's not any current check like this on the other accessors. Happy to add it though if there's a consensus. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- by fabpot at 2012-03-17T11:24:34Z What's the point is checking the hasser/getter/isser arguments. It's up to the developer to check if he can use them or not. Let's not complexify the code for this. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- by kriswallsmith at 2012-03-17T15:37:39Z My concern is that someone writes a hasser method on their model that is not intended for use with the form component but it's called anyway, leading to WTFs. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- by stof at 2012-04-03T22:28:21Z @fabpot what's your decision about this ? @jjbohn you need to rebase your PR. It conflicts with master as tests have been moved --------------------------------------------------------------------------- by bschussek at 2012-04-05T14:53:55Z @kriswallsmith is right. The check for 1 === $method->getNumberOfRequiredParameters() can (and should) easily be added to all of the if-clauses here. Apart from that, I'm okay with adding this.",PHP

"Fix using Clang as a cross compiler installed on a host machine and not inside of a sysroot targeting a system+sysroot which is ""similar"" or ""compatible"" with the host system. This shows up when trying to build system images on largely compatible hardware as-if fully cross compiled. The problem is that previously we *perfectly* mimiced GCC here, and it turns out GCC has a bug that no one has really stumbled across. GCC will try to look in thy system prefix ('/usr/local' f.ex.) into which it is instaled to find libraries installed along side GCC that should be preferred to the base system libraries ('/usr' f.ex.). This seems not unreasonable, but it has a very unfortunate consequence when combined with a '--sysroot' which does *not* contain the GCC installation we're using to complete the toolchain. That results in some of the host system's library directories being searched during the link. Now, it so happens that most folks doing stuff like this use '--with-sysroot' and '--disable-multilib' when configuring GCC. Even better, they're usually not cross-compiling to a target that is similar to the host. As a result, searching the host for libraries doesn't really matter -- most of the time weird directories get appended that don't exist (no arm triple lib directory, etc). Even if you're cross-compiling from 32-bit to 64-bit x86 or vice-versa, disabling multilib makes it less likely that you'll actually find viable libraries on the host. But that's just luck. We shouldn't rely on this, and this patch disables looking in the system prefix containing the GCC installation if that system prefix is *outside* of the sysroot. For empty sysroots, this has no effect. Similarly, when using the GCC *inside* of the sysroot, we still track wherever it is installed within the sysroot and look there for libraries. But now we can use a cross compiler GCC installation outside the system root, and only look for the crtbegin.o in the GCC installation, and look for all the other libraries inside the system root. This should fix PR12478, allowing Clang to be used when building a ChromiumOS image without polluting the image with libraries from the host system. git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/cfe/trunk@154176 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8",C++

"merged branch drak/session_flashmessages (PR #3267) Commits ------- 5ae76f1 [HttpFoundation] Update documentation. 910b5c7 [HttpFoudation] CS, more tests and some optimization. b0466e8 [HttpFoundation] Refactored BC Session class methods. 84c2e3c [HttpFoundation] Allow flash messages to have multiple messages per type. Discussion ---------- [2.1][HttpFoundation] Multiple session flash messages Bug fix: no Feature addition: yes Backwards compatibility break: yes, but this already happened in #2583. BC `Session` methods remain unbroken. Symfony2 tests pass: yes Fixes the following tickets: #1863 References the following tickets: #2714, #2753, #2510, #2543, #2853 Todo: - This PR alters flash messages so that it is possible to store more than one message per flash type using the `add()` method or by passing an array of messages to `set()`. __NOTES ABOUT BC__ This PR maintains BC behaviour with the `Session` class in that the old Symfony 2.0 methods will continue to work as before. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- by drak at 2012-02-13T06:28:33Z I think this is ready for review @fabpot @lsmith77 --------------------------------------------------------------------------- by lsmith77 at 2012-02-14T19:30:39Z the FlashBag vs. AutoExpireFlashBag behavior and setup difference should probably also be explained in the upgrading log --------------------------------------------------------------------------- by drak at 2012-02-15T04:43:14Z @lsmith77 Those differences are explained already in the changelog * Added `FlashBag`. Flashes expire when retrieved by `get()` or `all()`. This makes the implementation ESI compatible. * Added `AutoExpireFlashBag` (default) to replicate Symfony 2.0.x auto expire behaviour of messages auto expiring after one page page load. Messages must be retrived by `get()` or `all()`. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- by Crell at 2012-02-19T17:35:34Z Drak asked me to weigh in here with use cases. Drupal currently has a similar session-stored-messaging system in place that I'd like to be able to replace with Flash messages. We frequently have multiple messages within a single request, however, so this change is critical to our being able to do so. For instance, when saving an article in Drupal there is, by default, a ""yay, you saved an article!"" type message that gets displayed. If you also have the site configured to send email when a post is updated, you may see a ""email notifications sent"" message (depending on your access level). If you have a Solr server setup for search, and you're in debug mode, there will also be a ""record ID X added to Solr, it should update in 2 minutes"" message. And if there's a bug somewhere, you'll also get, as an error message rather than notice message, a ""Oops, E_NOTICE on line 54"" message. Form validation is another case. If you have multiple errors in a single form, we prefer to list all of them. So if you screw up 4 times on a form, you may get 4 different error messages showing what you screwed up so you can fix it in one go instead of several. Now sure, one could emulate that by building a multi-message layer on top of single-layer messages, but, really, why? ""One is a special case of many"", and there are many many cases where you'll want to post multiple messages. Like, most of Drupal. :-) --------------------------------------------------------------------------- by lsmith77 at 2012-03-06T20:55:51Z @fabpot is there any information you still need before merging this? do you want more discussion in which case you might want to take this to the mailing list .. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- by drak at 2012-03-08T18:54:13Z Another plus for this PR is that it requires no extra lines of code in templates etc to display the flashes, see https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/3267/files#diff-1 --------------------------------------------------------------------------- by drak at 2012-03-15T06:38:21Z Rebased against current `master`, should be mergeable again.. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- by evillemez at 2012-03-17T03:08:41Z +1 to this, I have an extended version of HttpFoundation just for this... would love to get rid of it.",PHP

Fix from Eric Dumazet. 11) do_tcp_sendpage() unloads the send queue way too fast, because it invokes tcp_push() when it shouldn't. Let the natural sequence generated by the splice paths, and the assosciated MSG_MORE settings, guide the tcp_push() calls. Otherwise what goes out of TCP is spaghetti and doesn't batch effectively into GSO/TSO clusters. From Eric Dumazet. 12) Once we put a SKB into either the netlink receiver's queue or a socket error queue, it can be consumed and freed up, therefore we cannot touch it after queueing it like that. Fixes from Eric Dumazet. 13) PPP has this annoying behavior in that for every transmit call it immediately stops the TX queue, then calls down into the next layer to transmit the PPP frame. But if that next layer can take it immediately, it just un-stops the TX queue right before returning from the transmit method. Besides being useless work, it makes several facilities unusable, in particular things like the equalizers. Well behaved devices should only stop the TX queue when they really are full, and in PPP's case when it gets backlogged to the downstream device. David Woodhouse therefore fixed PPP to not stop the TX queue until it's downstream can't take data any more. 14) IFF_UNICAST_FLT got accidently lost in some recent stmmac driver changes, re-add. From Marc Kleine-Budde. 15) Fix link flaps in ixgbe, from Eric W.

"making `body` an attribute of the request object; maybe fixes #445 This occurred to me as a potential workaround for issues with pre-request hooks being unable to alter `body` within their scope. Particularly those found in oauth-requests, where the `body` of a request cannot be recalculated. Here the issue seems to be that `body` is assigned as a local variable. So if we simply make `body` an attribute of the object we can manually override its value in the scope of the hook. This commit has been updated to rename `body` to `content` and to create an original value of the content variable, `_content` as well as a modified variable `content`.

"New Formula: avidemux Avidemux is a popular video editor, actively developed since 2001. Working with their lead engineer, the OSX code has been corrected, and now the formula will build avidemux2_cli, the command line version, with every video filter, encoder, and decoder available. In addition, if the user has Qt installed, this will automatically build the Qt gui, avidemux2. Several weeks of work also gets us a new CoreAudio output device for Qt, a feature missing since 2008. Macports has a portfile for 2.5.3, a very buggy version. The latest stable is 2.5.6. This formula will build stable or 2.5svn, which today is 2.5.6 r7750. The 2.5 branch, called avidemux2, is being finalized. The 2.6 branch, called avidemux3, is being very actively developed. EDIT: removed patches merged upstream EDIT: now compiles against r7668 on Lion. EDIT: fixes indentation, removes some debug commands EDIT: put two patches inline not on fileden EDIT: remove patches merged upstream, inline variable 'a' EDIT: add patch for ffmpeg compiling on 32bit OSX, switch url to 2.5.6 stable, add head (tested at r7724) EDIT: remove dep on libvpx that fails with XCode-4.3.

"merged branch bschussek/issue3661 (PR #3821) Commits ------- e0ce6b4 [Form] Fixed required value guessed by ValidatorTypeGuesser Discussion ---------- [Form] Fixed required value guessed by ValidatorTypeGuesser Bug fix: yes Feature addition: no Backwards compatibility break: no* Symfony2 tests pass: yes Fixes the following tickets: #3661 Todo: - ![Travis Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/bschussek/symfony.png?branch=issue3661) The documentation states that a field is set to required if constrained with NotBlank or NotNull and to not required otherwise. Due to a bug this was not the case and fields were always required. This is now fixed. The consequence is that some fields that were required before by default are not required anymore. The only difference is that the HTML5 ""required"" attribute disappears, because server-side validation did not occur before anyway.",PHP
