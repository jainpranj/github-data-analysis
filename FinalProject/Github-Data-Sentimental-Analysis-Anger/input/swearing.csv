"Address some review comments from Duncan. This moves the iterative offset accumulation to use a boring APInt instead of ConstantExprs.

If there is a significant penalty from using APInt here, first off WTF, and secondly let me know and I'll do the math by hand. I've left one layer still operating w/ ConstantExpr because it makes the interface quite a bit simpler, and that one isn't iterative so has much lower cost.

On the other hand, if this stuff is broken we're screwed in much more serious ways than content reading chrome locations, and using a consistent wrapper scheme allows us to make stronger asserts and assumptions. I opted for stronger assumptions and more understandable security code. If Blake feels strongly though, I could go the other way and sprinkle '|| isChrome(obj)' throughout the asserts though.",C++

"Fixed the build to work on Mac OS X Went back to a non-module based build of the final library. This means there won't be a bunch of mgine-<module-name>-module libraries, and just ONE mgine library. Also discovered that running the --analyze switch for clang will simply output text to a file, which ar and ranlib will happily concatenate. Fun times! I've decided to NOT use the -Wshadow warning for now, as it causes issues with my current naming conventions (where I do something like auto dat = this->dat; and any future references to dat will refer to the one most recently declared). However if it turns out that the compiler is free to do whatever it wants, I'm going to have to come up with better naming conventions, and then enable the setting. Still on the TODO is to add some cppcheck and clang static analyzer targets as part of the POST_BUILD process. I'm sure at some point I'll have something in place to write it to a file, or to display within vim or whatever. I'm still looking into additional static analysis tools, and I'm curious to see if there's a way to run it on OpenCL kernels, which would be VERY useful. I've unfortunately had to disable the header check on OS X, as it doesn't seem to work right. I've also temporarily disabled the python check as no tools (aside from *maybe* sphinx, but that is something different) currently depend on it. I think only a little bit more time is needed to get the CMake files up to where I would like them to be, however, I'll be adding CPack into the mix soon (for deb, rpm, os x installers, nsis etc.) for distribution, so that I can simply give out a precompiled setup for a developer. I wish CPack had WiX support, as I really do like the features that an MSI file provides (not to mention its a bit easier overall :P), but NSIS will have to do for now, I suppose. I'm sort of waiting on CMake 2.8.8 for the CPack features however, as it lets me make an MGineConfig.cmake file that gets distributed which will make developing something that uses the mgine a hell of a lot simpler. I have to say, I still don't *like* CMake, but once you find a few functions and notice yourself doing stuff quite often, easing the pain becomes a bit simpler. I do wish there was a better language available (at least tcl, or something), but I guess we're stuck with it. It's still a hell of a lot better than autohell though! :v",C++

"Make a seemingly tiny change to the inliner and fix the generated code size bloat. Unfortunately, I expect this to disable the majority of the benefit from r152737. I'm hopeful at least that it will fix PR12345. To explain this requires... quite a bit of backstory I'm afraid. TL;DR: The change in r152737 actually did The Wrong Thing for linkonce-odr functions. This change makes it do the right thing. The benefits we saw were simple luck, not any actual strategy. Benchmark numbers after a mini-blog-post so that I've written down my thoughts on why all of this works and doesn't work... To understand what's going on here, you have to understand how the ""bottom-up"" inliner actually works. There are two fundamental modes to the inliner: 1) Standard fixed-cost bottom-up inlining. This is the mode we usually think about. It walks from the bottom of the CFG up to the top, looking at callsites, taking information about the callsite and the called function and computing th expected cost of inlining into that callsite. If the cost is under a fixed threshold, it inlines. It's a touch more complicated than that due to all the bonuses, weights, etc. Inlining the last callsite to an internal function gets higher weighth, etc. But essentially, this is the mode of operation. 2) Deferred bottom-up inlining (a term I just made up). This is the interesting mode for this patch an r152737. Initially, this works just like mode #1, but once we have the cost of inlining into the callsite, we don't just compare it with a fixed threshold. First, we check something else. Let's give some names to the entities at this point, or we'll end up hopelessly confused. We're considering inlining a function 'A' into its callsite within a function 'B'. We want to check whether 'B' has any callers, and whether it might be inlined into those callers. If so, we also check whether inlining 'A' into 'B' would block any of the opportunities for inlining 'B' into its callers. We take the sum of the costs of inlining 'B' into its callers where that inlining would be blocked by inlining 'A' into 'B', and if that cost is less than the cost of inlining 'A' into 'B', then we skip inlining 'A' into 'B'. Now, in order for #2 to make sense, we have to have some confidence that we will actually have the opportunity to inline 'B' into its callers when cheaper, *and* that we'll be able to revisit the decision and inline 'A' into 'B' if that ever becomes the correct tradeoff. This often isn't true for external functions -- we can see very few of their callers, and we won't be able to re-consider inlining 'A' into 'B' if 'B' is external when we finally see more callers of 'B'. There are two cases where we believe this to be true for C/C++ code: functions local to a translation unit, and functions with an inline definition in every translation unit which uses them. These are represented as internal linkage and linkonce-odr (resp.) in LLVM. I enabled this logic for linkonce-odr in r152737. Unfortunately, when I did that, I also introduced a subtle bug. There was an implicit assumption that the last caller of the function within the TU was the last caller of the function in the program. We want to bonus the last caller of the function in the program by a huge amount for inlining because inlining that callsite has very little cost. Unfortunately, the last caller in the TU of a linkonce-odr function is *not* the last caller in the program, and so we don't want to apply this bonus. If we do, we can apply it to one callsite *per-TU*. Because of the way deferred inlining works, when it sees this bonus applied to one callsite in the TU for 'B', it decides that inlining 'B' is of the *utmost* importance just so we can get that final bonus. It then proceeds to essentially force deferred inlining regardless of the actual cost tradeoff. The result? PR12345: code bloat, code bloat, code bloat. Another result is getting *damn* lucky on a few benchmarks, and the over-inlining exposing critically important optimizations. I would very much like a list of benchmarks that regress after this change goes in, with bitcode before and after. This will help me greatly understand what opportunities the current cost analysis is missing. Initial benchmark numbers look very good. WebKit files that exhibited the worst of PR12345 went from growing to shrinking compared to Clang with r152737 reverted. - Bootstrapped Clang is 3% smaller with this change. - Bootstrapped Clang -O0 over a single-source-file of lib/Lex is 4% faster with this change. Please let me know about any other performance impact you see. Thanks to Nico for reporting and urging me to actually fix, Richard Smith, Duncan Sands, Manuel Klimek, and Benjamin Kramer for talking through the issues today.",C++

"Bug 733984 - Use the Location security policy even for content accessing chrome. r=mrbkap I'm adding asserts about when we do and don't have a Location object behind the wrapper, and this case was hitting them. What we do here doesn't so much matter given how this stuff all works. On the one hand, statically using a restrictive policy is slightly more defense-in-depth. On the other hand, if this stuff is broken we're screwed in much more serious ways than content reading chrome locations, and using a consistent wrapper scheme allows us to make stronger asserts and assumptions. I opted for stronger assumptions and more understandable security code. If Blake feels strongly though, I could go the other way and sprinkle '|| isChrome(obj)' throughout the asserts though.",C++

"Get rid of the useless flag PREEMPT_GEOLOCATION_PERMISSION https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=83325 Patch by Benjamin Poulain <bpoulain@apple.com> on 2012-04-06 Reviewed by Ryosuke Niwa. Source/WebCore: The flag WTF_USE_PREEMPT_GEOLOCATION_PERMISSION was added in r63742 but was never disabled by anyone. Supporting this feature added complexity by introducing two authorization scheme. This patch removes WTF_USE_PREEMPT_GEOLOCATION_PERMISSION and the code supporting granting the authorization after startUpdating(). * Modules/geolocation/Geolocation.cpp: (WebCore::Geolocation::GeoNotifier::runSuccessCallback): With the simplified authorization code, we ensure stronger constraint on GeoNotifier::runSuccessCallback(). (WebCore::Geolocation::stop): (WebCore::Geolocation::startRequest): (WebCore::Geolocation::clearWatch): (WebCore::Geolocation::setIsAllowed): (WebCore::Geolocation::positionChanged): The case (!isAllowed()) was there to support granting the authorization for WTF_USE_PREEMPT_GEOLOCATION_PERMISSION. (WebCore::Geolocation::handlePendingPermissionNotifiers): * Modules/geolocation/Geolocation.h: (Geolocation): Source/WebKit/blackberry: * WebCoreSupport/AboutDataUseFeatures.in: Source/WTF: * wtf/Platform.h: Remove the flag. git-svn-id: http://svn.webkit.org/repository/webkit/trunk@113505 268f45cc-cd09-0410-ab3c-d52691b4dbfc",C++

"merged branch stof/autoloader_refactoring (PR #3756) Commits ------- f1f1494 Added an exception when passing an invalid object to ApcClassLoader f5cb167 [ClassLoader] Added a DebugClassLoader using composition 0e54a22 Updated the changelog eae772e [ClassLoader] Added an ApcClassLoader 4d1333f Changed the test autoloading to use the new autoloader 09850bd [ClassLoader] Added a simplified PSR-0 ClassLoader Discussion ---------- Autoloader refactoring Bug fix: no Feature addition: yes Backwards compatibility break: no Symfony2 tests pass: [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/stof/symfony.png?branch=autoloader_refactoring)](http://travis-ci.org/stof/symfony) As discussed in #3623, I added a new ClassLoader instead of modifying the UniversalClassLoader, to be able to use the method names without BC concerns. The new class works the same than the composer autoloader regarding the handling of fallbacks, to be able to reuse namespace maps generated by composer. ```php <?php // autoload.php require_once __DIR__.'/vendor/symfony/class-loader/Symfony/Component/ClassLoader/ClassLoader.php'; $loader = new Symfony\Component\ClassLoader\ClassLoader(); $map = require __DIR__.'/vendor/.composer/autoload_namespaces.php'; $loader->addPrefixes($map); $loader->register(); ``` Differences with the composer class loader: - Composer's ``add`` method is named ``addPrefix`` in the Symfony ClassLoader - the methods related to the class map are removed as Symfony has a separate laoder for class maps - the ``addPrefixes`` method is added, accepting a namespace map. I also added a new ApcClassLoader which uses composition instead of inheriting from a class loader, which makes it far more easier to reuse (we could wrap a Composer autoloader with it for instance). ```php <?php $composerLoader = require __DIR__.'/vendor/.composer/autoload.php'; // no need to require the file manually as Composer already registered its autoloader $cachedLoader = new Symfony\Component\ClassLoader\ApcClassLoader('autoload.my_app', $composerLoader); $cachedLoader->register(); // unregister the Composer autoloader as we wrapped it in the ApcClassLoader $composerLoader->unregister(); ``` TODO: - refactor the Debug class loader to use composition too to be able to support different class loaders --------------------------------------------------------------------------- by fabpot at 2012-04-02T16:31:28Z Can you update the CHANGELOG and the UPGRADE file accordingly? --------------------------------------------------------------------------- by stof at 2012-04-02T16:47:43Z I added a note in the CHANGELOG. There is nothing to add in the UPGRADE file as the change is fully BC (I did not change the UniversalClassLoader at all so it can still be used). I'm working on the Debug loader right now so please wait a bit before merging --------------------------------------------------------------------------- by stof at 2012-04-02T17:12:11Z Here is a new DebugClassLoader using composition too. this way, it is able to support the UniversalClassLoader, the ApcUniversalClassLoader (without dropping the use of APC as done previously), the new ClassLoader, the new ApcClassLoader and even the composer autoloader. I'm not sure about the use of ``method_exists`` as it could break if an autoloader implements a protected ``findFile`` method (crappy PHP :cry:) but hardcoding the supported classes would be a pain and requiring an interface would make the autoloaders more difficult to use (as the interface would need to be required first) and would drop the support of the composer autoloader.",PHP

"Merge branch 'drm-fixes-intel' of git://people.freedesktop.org/~airlied/linux Pull drm update from Dave Airlie: ""This pull just contains a forward of the Intel fixes from Daniel. The only annoyance is the RC6 enable, which really should have made -next, but since Ubuntu are shipping it I reckon its getting a good testing now by the time 3.4 comes out. The pull from Daniel contains his pull message to me: ""A few patches for 3.4, major part is 3 regression fixes: - ppgtt broke hibernate on snb/ivb. Somehow our QA claims that it still works, which is why this has not been caught earlier. - ppgtt flails in combination with dmar. I kinda expected this one :( - fence handling bugfix for gen2/3. Iirc this one is about a year old, fix curtesy Chris Wilson. I've created an shockingly simple i-g-t test to catch this in the future."" Wrt regressions I've just got a report that gmbus (newly enabled again in 3.4) is a bit noisy. I'm looking into this atm. Also included are the rc6 enable patches for snb from Eugeni. I wanted to include these in the main 3.4 pull but screwed it up. Please hit me. Imo these kind of patches really should go in before -rc1, but in thise case rc6 has brought us tons of press and guinea pigs^W^W testers and ubuntu is already running with it. So I estimate a pretty small chance for this to blow up. And some smaller things: - two minor locking snafus - server gt2 ivb pciid - 2 patches to sanitize the register state left behind by the bios some more - 2 new quirk entries - cs readback trick against missed IRQs from ivb also enabled on snb - sprite fix from Jesse"" Let's see if the ""enable RC6 on sandybridge"" finally works and sticks. I've been enabling it by hand (i915.i915_enable_rc6=1) for several months on my Macbook Air, and it definitely makes a difference (and has worked for me).

Levels and shit!,ooc
Bend over bass ackwards to save a few bytes in the KeyDir. Instead of using a separate byte array for keys and values use a single byte array. This saves a 4-byte length prefix (unless the JVM magically shrinks those) and in the future with a map implementation that doesn't suck it could use the same array reference for both key and value saving 4-8 bytes for the reference to the key/value. Combine that with compressed object references and you are actually looking at a pretty space efficient implementation. Need to find a suitably licensed tree implementation to hack on. Also stop storing the length of the value in the keydir saving another four bytes. Then length is stored with the value (and header) and is CRCed by both header CRC and value CRC so they can be evaluated separately without CRCing extra bytes. The tradeoff is a lot of complexity and an extra JNI call for reads to do the CRC. My hope is that the CRC implementation of the JVM will become an intrinsic.,Java

"sys-devel/gnuconfig: ultra-prefixification I've been patching these in other ebuilds like a drunken patchmonkey but this time I carefully evaluated all the hard-paths and decided that almost every single one of them is intended to capture a platform quirk of some kind or another and therefore they shouldn't be ultraprefixified. However that still leaves the scripts themselves and few random spots. Likely this will break some other patches which is fine -- they should be removed anyhow as I now believe I was far too gung-ho with them anyhow, plus this is a good way to start shrinking the rediculous amount of ultraprefix diffs I now have in-tree. For now I'm going to consider this ultraprefixification crap to be solved. The patches are doing what I wanted, which is, mostly, preventing bash-subshell-fork disasters in libtool. My next cyglibtool hack attempt -- when I get to it -- will probably involve attempting to prevent those subshells in the first place. If we are lucky this might just be enough to allow us to chuck all this ultra-prefixification crap in the bit bucket where it very much belongs (actually it does have some limited utility for prefix users on ancient dinosaurs with severely broken /bin/sh, which is a real-world problem that does crop up on occasion... even so I doubt the cost-bene adds up considering we have to keep maintaining these gigantic piles steaming patchpoo to sustain the feature going forward).",Shell

"hugetlbfs: remove unregister_filesystem() when initializing module It was introduced by d1d5e05ffdc1 (""hugetlbfs: return error code when initializing module"") but as Al pointed out, is a bad idea. Quoted comments from Al: ""Note that unregister_filesystem() in module init is *always* wrong; it's not an issue here (it's done too early to care about and realistically the box is not going anywhere - it'll panic when attempt to exec /sbin/init fails, if not earlier), but it's a damn bad example. Consider a normal fs module. Somebody loads it and in parallel with that we get a mount attempt on that fs type. It comes between register and failure exits that causes unregister; at that point we are screwed since grabbing a reference to module as done by mount is enough to prevent exit, but not to prevent the failure of init. As the result, module will get freed when init fails, mounted fs of that type be damned."" So remove it.

Symfony2 tests pass: yes Fixes the following tickets: #1863 References the following tickets: #2714, #2753, #2510, #2543, #2853 Todo: - This PR alters flash messages so that it is possible to store more than one message per flash type using the `add()` method or by passing an array of messages to `set()`. __NOTES ABOUT BC__ This PR maintains BC behaviour with the `Session` class in that the old Symfony 2.0 methods will continue to work as before. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- by drak at 2012-02-13T06:28:33Z I think this is ready for review @fabpot @lsmith77 --------------------------------------------------------------------------- by lsmith77 at 2012-02-14T19:30:39Z the FlashBag vs. AutoExpireFlashBag behavior and setup difference should probably also be explained in the upgrading log --------------------------------------------------------------------------- by drak at 2012-02-15T04:43:14Z @lsmith77 Those differences are explained already in the changelog * Added `FlashBag`. Flashes expire when retrieved by `get()` or `all()`. This makes the implementation ESI compatible. * Added `AutoExpireFlashBag` (default) to replicate Symfony 2.0.x auto expire behaviour of messages auto expiring after one page page load. Messages must be retrived by `get()` or `all()`. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- by Crell at 2012-02-19T17:35:34Z Drak asked me to weigh in here with use cases. Drupal currently has a similar session-stored-messaging system in place that I'd like to be able to replace with Flash messages. We frequently have multiple messages within a single request, however, so this change is critical to our being able to do so. For instance, when saving an article in Drupal there is, by default, a ""yay, you saved an article!"" type message that gets displayed. If you also have the site configured to send email when a post is updated, you may see a ""email notifications sent"" message (depending on your access level). If you have a Solr server setup for search, and you're in debug mode, there will also be a ""record ID X added to Solr, it should update in 2 minutes"" message. And if there's a bug somewhere, you'll also get, as an error message rather than notice message, a ""Oops, E_NOTICE on line 54"" message. Form validation is another case. If you have multiple errors in a single form, we prefer to list all of them. So if you screw up 4 times on a form, you may get 4 different error messages showing what you screwed up so you can fix it in one go instead of several. Now sure, one could emulate that by building a multi-message layer on top of single-layer messages, but, really, why? ""One is a special case of many"", and there are many many cases where you'll want to post multiple messages. Like, most of Drupal. :-) --------------------------------------------------------------------------- by lsmith77 at 2012-03-06T20:55:51Z @fabpot is there any information you still need before merging this? do you want more discussion in which case you might want to take this to the mailing list .. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- by drak at 2012-03-08T18:54:13Z Another plus for this PR is that it requires no extra lines of code in templates etc to display the flashes, see https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/3267/files#diff-1 --------------------------------------------------------------------------- by drak at 2012-03-15T06:38:21Z Rebased against current `master`, should be mergeable again.. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- by evillemez at 2012-03-17T03:08:41Z +1 to this, I have an extended version of HttpFoundation just for this... would love to get rid of it.",PHP

"Lots of errors, read I can't decide if I want to code this in such a way that it'll be easy for us to adapt for gamemodes with more than 2 players. Its kinda makin everything infinitely more difficult. Have a look for yourself at the changes, some of its gettin pretty messy. I know theres a crap ton of errors, but I'm tired and I need to sleep on it. Major Changes * Added tempData class to handle my mess of hashMaps * Added put, remove, and get methods for those hashMaps * Moved all previously initialized hashMaps to that class * In most cases, the challenging player is set as the key, and BOTH players are in the Player[] *I'm currently in the middle of rewriting the challenge accept/decline command because I want it to be universal for all gamemodes AND assimilate it to the new Player[] maps. Most of this should be cleaned up by sometime tomorrow.",Java

The add button and prompt label have been moved to leftView and rightView properties rather than separate subviews. TIToken is now a UIControl and doesn't have a delegate. You should respond to events with addTarget:action:forControlEvents It also has a property for a representedObject (like a custom Contact class you might want to link to it).",Objective-C

"Introduce a speculative intermediate langauge, and describe a translation into this intermediate language that also effectively typecheckes the surface syntax. Arguably, a better thing to do would be to typecheck the intermediate language, but my thought here is that we might want to add position information to the external language to give more reasonable error messages, but to erase this position information after typechecking and translating into the intermediate language. Currently, the typechecking part is completely broken, because I'm not actually extending the environment with new bindings or looking up bindings in the environment.

Added additional statistics showing how many NPCs, and how many of each type of NPC are currently in game. Changed current stats to Top 200 Active, added stats for credits, gold coins and gold nuggets. Added list of all players (active and inactive). Raised HP Levels on certain buildings. This is not retroactive, but will take when new buildings are created. 09-26-11 - Added new Statistics page (available from the menu buttons)... it looks like crap right now but shows a few additional stats and I'll be adding a lot more over time. Also, you can now see 200 profiles from the Rankings page (shows both active and inactive players) and when you click on a profile, it shows whether they're active or inactive. Lastly, I stabbed Frags through the heart and it's now gone from the Rankings page. Will still show when you kill someone until I remove that message. 09-24-11 - Added new integrated Wiki to Light Rising Forum. 09-22-11 - You can now craft gold earrings and necklaces from gold nuggets, using the new metallurgy skill. 09-15-11 - Acme Laser Weapons can now be Recycled for Galactic Credits - Pistols - 5 Credits, Rifles - 15 Credits, Swords - 50 Credits, Cannons - 65 Credits.

Self Revive Bug is Fixed. 09-10-2011 - Laser Rifles, Swords, and Cannons are now purchasable in an Armory Building (using the craft skill & credits). Armory Buildings now available to build within settlements. New Armory Builder Skill. Eyeball Soup now heals for 5HP as a default, and 15HP with the Barkeep Skill. Game & IRC Chat Menu Links are now available from the Light Rising Forum. LR Forum is now open for registrations again. I'm testing some heavier duty anti-spam plugins, so please let me know if you have a problem registering (email me at support@lightrising.com). You can also register via OpenID... alas, currently on the forum only, not the game... but you can also register with a regular password. 09-09-2011 - Mutant Miners are now appearing in the Biosphere East mining village. There are also pure gold nuggets to be found. If you know where to look! Pots of Flour now give 15XP instead of 5. 09-07-2011 - A ruined Mutant mine village, and mine entrance has been uncovered in Biosphere East! 08-20-2011 - Herbal Poultices now give 50HP when used to Revive. Herbal Teas now give 100HP when used to revive. Bar Drinks now give 5HP with no skill, or 15HP with the barkeep skill. A Plasma Earthquake has erupted in Biosphere East. Be careful out there. Forum Registration is currently disabled due to spammers. Please email me at support@lightrising.com or ask in game and I will manually register your account. This applies to the forum only. 07-31-2011 - A new maintenance duct has been found, leading into the undiscovered part of Biosphere East. It's rumored that there's a hidden valley that's a high value and very well protected settlement location. New Players now receive 3 Herbal Poultices, and a Ballistic Knife, along with the original 9 Noobcakes. Forum Registration is currently set to Admin approval to try and cut down on the number of spam accounts. 07-25-2011 - Light Rising is now in Open Beta! You no longer have to wait for a manual unlock when you create a new account. You can create multiple characters, but you will only be able to play one per day unless you donate a minimum of $5, which will then allow you to play upto 3 characters per day. Modified AP Movement Cost across multiple tiles. It's more appropriate now. 07-24-2011 - An unidentified Alien threat has attacked the Ascension Settlement and destroyed three emergency shelters! 07-23-2011 - It seems an alien virus has infected much of the wild food sources, restricting the amount of wild food available. Farmed food is unaffected. Head Removal is now under the Pirate class. Requires purchase of that class but it makes it accessible to everyone, not just chainsaw enthusiasts. 07-20-2011 - New Item - Severed Head on a Pike (requires Trailblazing skill and some rebar) then you can place your freshly removed enemy's head on a pike for all to see! New Skill - Enemy Head Removal (requires Chainsaw skills) allows you to remove your enemy's head when you kill them. Fixed Chat Button overlap bug. 07-17-2011 - Due to a shift in the inter-dimensional rift, damaged bulkhead doors are now accessible with the electronic lock repair skill (including Biosphere NW!)

This will allow for metal and concrete buildings, and barricades. 06-27-2011 - All Active Accounts and New Players received the skill tree modification upgrade.

Discussion ---------- [2.1][HttpFoundation] Multiple session flash messages Bug fix: no Feature addition: yes Backwards compatibility break: yes, but this already happened in #2583. BC `Session` methods remain unbroken. Symfony2 tests pass: yes Fixes the following tickets: #1863 References the following tickets: #2714, #2753, #2510, #2543, #2853 Todo: - This PR alters flash messages so that it is possible to store more than one message per flash type using the `add()` method or by passing an array of messages to `set()`. __NOTES ABOUT BC__ This PR maintains BC behaviour with the `Session` class in that the old Symfony 2.0 methods will continue to work as before. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- by drak at 2012-02-13T06:28:33Z I think this is ready for review @fabpot @lsmith77 --------------------------------------------------------------------------- by lsmith77 at 2012-02-14T19:30:39Z the FlashBag vs. AutoExpireFlashBag behavior and setup difference should probably also be explained in the upgrading log --------------------------------------------------------------------------- by drak at 2012-02-15T04:43:14Z @lsmith77 Those differences are explained already in the changelog * Added `FlashBag`. Flashes expire when retrieved by `get()` or `all()`. This makes the implementation ESI compatible. * Added `AutoExpireFlashBag` (default) to replicate Symfony 2.0.x auto expire behaviour of messages auto expiring after one page page load. Messages must be retrived by `get()` or `all()`. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- by Crell at 2012-02-19T17:35:34Z Drak asked me to weigh in here with use cases. Drupal currently has a similar session-stored-messaging system in place that I'd like to be able to replace with Flash messages. We frequently have multiple messages within a single request, however, so this change is critical to our being able to do so. For instance, when saving an article in Drupal there is, by default, a ""yay, you saved an article!"" type message that gets displayed. If you also have the site configured to send email when a post is updated, you may see a ""email notifications sent"" message (depending on your access level). If you have a Solr server setup for search, and you're in debug mode, there will also be a ""record ID X added to Solr, it should update in 2 minutes"" message. And if there's a bug somewhere, you'll also get, as an error message rather than notice message, a ""Oops, E_NOTICE on line 54"" message. Form validation is another case. If you have multiple errors in a single form, we prefer to list all of them. So if you screw up 4 times on a form, you may get 4 different error messages showing what you screwed up so you can fix it in one go instead of several. Now sure, one could emulate that by building a multi-message layer on top of single-layer messages, but, really, why? ""One is a special case of many"", and there are many many cases where you'll want to post multiple messages. Like, most of Drupal. :-) --------------------------------------------------------------------------- by lsmith77 at 2012-03-06T20:55:51Z @fabpot is there any information you still need before merging this? do you want more discussion in which case you might want to take this to the mailing list .. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- by drak at 2012-03-08T18:54:13Z Another plus for this PR is that it requires no extra lines of code in templates etc to display the flashes, see https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/3267/files#diff-1 --------------------------------------------------------------------------- by drak at 2012-03-15T06:38:21Z Rebased against current `master`, should be mergeable again.. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- by evillemez at 2012-03-17T03:08:41Z +1 to this, I have an extended version of HttpFoundation just for this... would love to get rid of it.",PHP

"readline() honors 0x7f Qemu sends an 0x7f (DEL) via serial when you hit backspace, and readline was ignoring it.

"[chromium] CCLayerTreeHost / WebLayerTreeView should be single ownership, not RefCounted https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=83413 Patch by James Robinson <jamesr@chromium.org> on 2012-04-09 Reviewed by Adrienne Walker. Source/Platform: This makes WebLayerTreeView noncopyable to better match the underlying semantics. There is no code currently that attempts to copy WebLayerTreeView instances. * chromium/public/WebLayerTreeView.h: (WebKit): (WebLayerTreeView): Source/WebCore: CCLayerTreeHost always has a single logical owner, typically a WebLayerTreeView via either WebViewImpl or the public API. It is currently refcounted for historical reasons but this isn't necessary and adds confusion. CCLayerTreeHost instances and pointers are carefully managed currently to avoid leaks. In particular, while LayerChromium instances hold RefPtr<CCLayerTreeHost>s, whenever we want to destroy a CCLayerTreeHost we proactively clear out these references inside setRootLayer() to break the cycle. Refactor covered by existing unit and layout tests. * platform/graphics/chromium/LayerChromium.cpp: (WebCore::LayerChromium::LayerChromium): (WebCore::LayerChromium::setMaskLayer): (WebCore::LayerChromium::setReplicaLayer): * platform/graphics/chromium/LayerChromium.h: (WebCore::LayerChromium::layerTreeHost): (LayerChromium): * platform/graphics/chromium/cc/CCLayerTreeHost.cpp: (WebCore::CCLayerTreeHost::create): * platform/graphics/chromium/cc/CCLayerTreeHost.h: (CCLayerTreeHost): Source/WebKit/chromium: Updates tests and implementation for RefPtr->OwnPtr switch. One nice benefit is that since WebLayerTreeView is explicitly owned by the user of the API we can safely rely on them managing the lifetime of the client and thus don't have to null check the client all the time. * src/WebLayerTreeView.cpp: (WebKit::WebLayerTreeView::reset): (WebKit::WebLayerTreeView::isNull): (WebKit::WebLayerTreeView::initialize): * src/WebLayerTreeViewImpl.cpp: (WebKit::WebLayerTreeViewImpl::create): (WebKit::WebLayerTreeViewImpl::willBeginFrame): (WebKit::WebLayerTreeViewImpl::updateAnimations): (WebKit::WebLayerTreeViewImpl::layout): (WebKit::WebLayerTreeViewImpl::applyScrollAndScale): (WebKit::WebLayerTreeViewImpl::createContext): (WebKit::WebLayerTreeViewImpl::didRecreateContext): (WebKit::WebLayerTreeViewImpl::didCommit): (WebKit::WebLayerTreeViewImpl::didCommitAndDrawFrame): (WebKit::WebLayerTreeViewImpl::didCompleteSwapBuffers): (WebKit::WebLayerTreeViewImpl::scheduleComposite): * src/WebLayerTreeViewImpl.h: (WebLayerTreeViewImpl): * tests/CCLayerTreeHostTest.cpp: (WTF::MockLayerTreeHost::create): (CCLayerTreeHostTest): * tests/Canvas2DLayerChromiumTest.cpp: * tests/LayerChromiumTest.cpp: * tests/TiledLayerChromiumTest.cpp: (WTF::TEST): git-svn-id: http://svn.webkit.org/repository/webkit/trunk@113623 268f45cc-cd09-0410-ab3c-d52691b4dbfc",C++

"{fetch,receive}-pack: skip sha-1 integrity test on objects from new pack When we fetch or push, usually ""git rev-list --verify-objects --not --all --stdin"" is used to make sure that all objects between existing refs and new refs are good. This means no gaps in between, all objects are well-formed, object content agrees with its sha-1 signature. For the last one, --verify-objects calls check_sha1_signature() via parse_object(). check_sha1_signature() is an expensive operation, especially when new refs are far away from existing ones because all objects in between are re-hashed. Because objects coming from the new pack are already hashed by index-pack, we can trust their integrity. The only objects left to check are existing ones in repo but has no connection to any current refs. Pass the new pack id down to--verify-objects and skip check_sha1_signature() on objects from that pack. As an (extreme) example, a repository is created with only one commit: e83c516 (Initial revision of ""git"", the information manager from hell - 2005-04-07). The rest of git.git is fetched on top.

"Fully clear the audio ringbuffer when using AC3 re-encoder When the audio buffer was reset, we could find ourselves in a situation where a full audio frame may not have fitted at the end of the ring buffer. This would have resulted in channels being shifted for a short period of time when we rollled over in the buffer. This situation could only happen when using the AC3 encoder as we change the size of an audio frame half-way through. When the AC3 re-encoder is in use, we now fully clear the audio buffer and fill it with zero. That way at worse we hear silence instead of crap and not have to worry about threading issues. Add some extra logging that will clearly show an error should this condition occurs again. Will help troubleshoot should any issues remain. Additionally, from Mark Spieth, fully reset any audio processing unit that could have cached old audio. Should fix #10396 Thanks Mark for actually spotting what went wrong",C

"Summary: Cleaned up code standards and added a host of functions from my personal toolkit. Removed DataStore as it was kind of silly. Updated qunit. - Removed `engine.dataStore()` - It was a stupid function. * Modified `RedLocomotive()` - Returns the engine instead of passing it to a callback. Use `engine.on('ready', callback)` instead of the callback. + Added `engine.clone()` - Clones an object. + Added `engine.compare()` - Compares to objects and returns a boolean. True if both have the same properties and values, false if they do not. + Added `engine.reduce()` - Takes to objects and trims the first to only contain properties that the second also has. + Added `engine.mirror()` - Takes two objects and makes the first have the same properties and values as the second and removes anything else. + Added `engine.watch()` - Takes a single object and returns an event emitter that will fire an `update` event when the object changes. Note this only happens once per tick. + Added `engine.distance()` - Calculates the distance from zero zero to a pair of x and y coordinates. + Added `engine.degree()` - Calculates the degree from zero zero to a pair of x and y coordinates. + Added `engine.vector()` - Calculates both the degree and distance from zero zero to a pair of x and y coordinates. + Added `engine.coordinates()` - Calculates both the x and y coordinates from a degree and distance from zero zero. + Added `engine.tan()` + Added `engine.sin()` + Added `engine.cos()` + Added `engine.atan()` + Added `engine.asin()` + Added `engine.acos()` !
