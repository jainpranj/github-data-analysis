"Add iSCSI sharing to ZoL. Sixth official patch attempt. Previous ones was/is lost in my inability with GIT. * Script to run through some tests to test share/unsharing... * Debugging output added. * Retabbing * Fix faulty nfs|smb check (setting ZFS_TYPE_FILESYSTEM). Now possible to use 'share -a [nfs|smb|iscsi] as command line suggests. Not documented in man page though... + In unshare_unmount(), 'if(do_all)', 'continue' instead of 'break' after checking 'sharenfs=off' (so that we can continue checking for shareiscsi and sharesmb). * Process iscsi shares early in update_zfs_shares_cb(). * Fix problem with assertion fail when running 'zfs unshare -a'. * Call process_share() early of update_zfs_shares_cb() if iSCSI. * Add shell script (test_zfs.sh) to test some functionality of SMB/iSCSI patch(es). + Remove file_is_executable() from iSCSI per request from Brian. Fix some stuff that I know Brian will nag about :) * 80 char line * Move content of README to code + man page. * Remove all debugging. * Return SA_OK instead of 0 where needed. * Cast to char* when setting argv with constant string(s). * C9x compliance * Make private functions static. Some minor iSCSI fixes, comments from Richard Laager: * Remove redundant variable = NULL check. * Rename the custom iSCSI share script (remove .sh suffix). + Reword manual Some more iSCSI fixes. * Since iscsi_retrieve_targets() is now static, move it up to the top of iscsi.c and remove from iscsi.h. * In update_zfs_shares_cb(), do the iSCSI parts later and skip the if type != FS check etc. * Implement iscsi_validate_shareopts(). * Distinguish between FS and VOL when updating share information. + Support adding a VOL to list. * Uncomment some stuff in process_share() that is/was supposed to possibly fix the 'shareicsi=on' auto sharing but didn't.

"In the convenience file_update structure, we sometimes have the wantmd5 field point at memory directly in the read buffer, in which case we must not try to free() it. This is most likely a petty micro-optimization, but nevertheless, it was achieved by setting this field to NULL after we were done with it (so, in a place that was potentially far from the initial assignment). This has confused myself and others in the past, so try to sort this out once and for all. Have a free_wantmd5 field in the file_update structure indicating whether the wantmd5 field needs to be freed or not. In the few places where we want that behaviour, it can be set right after the field has been initialized, making the whole thing a lot more obvious. Also rename fup_cleanup() to fup_reset(), I find it more intuitive.",C

"Typeahead: separate the name field from the field we complete on Summary: Let typeahead datasources provide an optional field: tokenizable. If present, the typeahead tokenizes and completes on this field instead of name, but still uses the name when inputting data into the <input>. For example, I can have an input for Phabricator commit identifiers, and build typeahead from (commit-identifier, commit-message-summary-line) pairs. The 'display' field formats both prettily, the 'name' is the commit-identifier, and the 'tokenizable' contains both commit-identifier and commit-message concatenated. The typeahead lets me search both, but the resulting value in the <input> is just the commit-identifier. Test Plan: Made an example as described above which queries all my commits to a repo from the past week.

"ash: Remap Command on Apple keyboards to Control [2/2] This is yusukes's http://codereview.chromium.org/9854025/ with my review comments applied. chrome/browser/chromeos/xinput_hierarchy_changed_event_listener.cc: * Every time when a new device is added, notify the name of the device to KeyRewriter. * Listens to XI_KeyPress and XI_KeyRelease events to the X root window, and notify the device ID of the event to KeyRewriter so that the rewriter could know the source of the next KeyPress/KeyRelease Core event. Note that it's not possible to monitor both XI_KeyPress and core KeyPress events for a single X window. For example, if we monitor XI_KeyPress events in aura::RootWindowHostLinux (by calling XISelectEvents() for the root Aura window, xwindow_), it becomes impossible to receive KeyPress core events for |xwindow_| in RootWindowHostLinux. It's also impossible to convert XI_KeyPress into core KeyPress. That is the reason why xinput_hierarchy_changed_event_listener.cc is used to monitor XI_KeyPress/Release events. chrome/browser/ui/views/ash/key_rewriter.cc: * Rewrites Command key press on an Apple keyboard to Control key press, regardless of the user preference for remapping modifier keys.

Clang doesn't have it. * Remove the instruction to the user to `sudo ln -s`. * Remove the fails_with_llvm. It compiles against llvm 2336. * Inreplaces should persist through version updates. * Respect the developer's choice that optimization is best at -O2. * Remove the hardcoded -O2 so we can set -O2 or switch to -Og. * Override the hardcoded CC=gcc.

"Be able to search for Differential and other short strings Summary: I wanted to search for D1234 in texts of other documents. But search tool always redirects me. I've left the redirect behavior for simple search forms (header and home) and removed it from full search form. I don't consider this complete because the first result in search for D1234 should be of course D1234 which is not the case currently. I am not sure how to solve it: - We can display a special result in this case. - We can index the documents so that they will be searchable also for short strings. I tend to use the first solution because revisions can be truncated at arbitrary length (rX1f1f1f should display revision rX1f1f1f1f1f1f1f). Test Plan: Search for D1234, rX123, T4.

"cdc-wdm: Fix more races on the read path commit 711c68b3c0f7a924ffbee4aa962d8f62b85188ff upstream. We must not allow the input buffer length to change while we're shuffling the buffer contents. We also mustn't clear the WDM_READ flag after more data might have arrived. Therefore move both of these into the spinlocked region at the bottom of wdm_read(). When reading desc->length without holding the iuspin lock, use ACCESS_ONCE() to ensure the compiler doesn't re-read it with inconsistent results.

"Use explicit relative imports everywhere Since implicit relative imports aren't available in Python 3, all package-internal imports in PIL were absolute imports for the named module. This meant that import Image as from PIL import Image did not work correctly. It imports the module 'PIL.Image', and is registered in 'sys.modules' under that name. Since all plugins use absolute imports, they import a module named 'Image', which will be a separate entry in 'sys.modules'. In consequence, the original import cannot see any of the plugins. This patch changes all imports to explicit relative imports. At least one import cycle that happened to work before had to be resolved, maybe there are more. The patch did not receive too much testing, but made things work for me.",C

Templates stored under full path now. skip/ignore use File.fnmatch - file path matching - now. - DeferredLoader changed to DataManager - Added YamlDoc support to data collections -- a data format (.yamldoc) that strips YAML front matter and puts the content under the key 'content', or it will use a custom key from the front matter if the value of the pair is '_YAMLDOC_' - Templates are stored under their short name and full path now. - skip/ignore (blacklist and greylist) now use File.fnmatch instead of starts_with? for matching paths",JavaScript

Change location information for synthesized properties to be at the property file/line rather than the @synthesize file/line. Avoids some nasty confusing-ness with conflating the file from the scope and the line from the original declaration. Use the current scope location as a separate parameter so that we can match it up better in the line table with the beginning of the scope. Update a couple of testcases accordingly since I had to change that we actually use the passed in location in EmitFunctionStart and for the new metadata parameter and add a new testcase to make sure we've got the right line numbers for synthesized properties.

"Point SPEC_LOAD_URI to http URI, not file URI. SPEC_LOAD_URI was set file:validator/spec/html5.html by default, but as part of the portable-jar changes, all other places where we were using file URIs are now reading from validator.jar instead, and actually the VerifierServletTransaction.java code is always using LocalCacheEntityResolver.getHtml5SpecAsStream to load the spec for validator.jar anyway, and never using SPEC_LOAD_URI. If we think it's useful to keep that ability to have the option to read the spec from the current source over http rather than reading from the static copy we have in the validator code, then I can update the code to make SPEC_LOAD_URI actually work. If not, I guess should remove SPEC_LOAD_URI and references to it, and just always have the code use the static copy.",Java

KBuild: Allow scripts/* to be cross compiled Cross compiling the binaries in scripts/* is not possible because various makefiles assume that $(obj)/whatever is executable on the build host. This patch introduces a new variable called KBUILD_SCRIPTROOT that points to script/binaries to use while cross compiling. Usage: Build scripts for the build host: make O=path/to/buildhost/buildscripts \ silentoldconfig prepare scripts Then cross build script for target: make O=path/to/target/buildscripts \ HOSTCC=$CROSS_COMPILE \ KBUILD_SCRIPTROOT=path/to/buildhost/buildscripts silentoldconfig prepare scripts This patch does not use KBUILD_SCRIPTROOT for all script invocations it only redefines the following if KBUILD_SCRIPTROOT is defined. scripts/Makefile.build scripts/basic/fixdep --> $(KBUILD_SCRIPTROOT)/scripts/basic/fixdep scripts/kconfig/Makefile $(obj)/conf --> $(KBUILD_SCRIPTROOT)/scripts/kconfig/conf scripts/mod/Makefile $(obj)mk_elfconfig --> $(KBUILD_SCRIPTROOT)/scripts/mod/mk_elfconfig Signed-off-by: John Rigby <john.rigby@linaro.org>,C

Change location information for synthesized properties to be at the property file/line rather than the @synthesize file/line. Avoids some nasty confusing-ness with conflating the file from the scope and the line from the original declaration. Use the current scope location as a separate parameter so that we can match it up better in the line table with the beginning of the scope. Update a couple of testcases accordingly since I had to change that we actually use the passed in location in EmitFunctionStart and for the new metadata parameter and add a new testcase to make sure we've got the right line numbers for synthesized properties.

"Print human readable error message for ENOENT A cryptic error code is printed when mounting a legacy dataset to a non-existent mountpoint.

The single quotes were added to be consistent with the existing EBUSY error message, which is the only difference between this error message and the one that is printed when the same condition occurs when mounting procfs.",C

Now possible to use 'share -a [nfs|smb|iscsi] as command line suggests. Not documented in man page though... + In unshare_unmount(), 'if(do_all)', 'continue' instead of 'break' after checking 'sharenfs=off' (so that we can continue checking for shareiscsi and sharesmb). * Process iscsi shares early in update_zfs_shares_cb(). * Fix problem with assertion fail when running 'zfs unshare -a'. * Call process_share() early of update_zfs_shares_cb() if iSCSI. * Add shell script (test_zfs.sh) to test some functionality of SMB/iSCSI patch(es). + Remove file_is_executable() from iSCSI per request from Brian. Fix some stuff that I know Brian will nag about :) * 80 char line * Move content of README to code + man page. * Remove all debugging. * Return SA_OK instead of 0 where needed. * Cast to char* when setting argv with constant string(s). * C9x compliance * Make private functions static. Some minor iSCSI fixes, comments from Richard Laager: * Remove redundant variable = NULL check. * Rename the custom iSCSI share script (remove .sh suffix). + Reword manual Some more iSCSI fixes. * Since iscsi_retrieve_targets() is now static, move it up to the top of iscsi.c and remove from iscsi.h. * In update_zfs_shares_cb(), do the iSCSI parts later and skip the if type != FS check etc. * Implement iscsi_validate_shareopts(). * Distinguish between FS and VOL when updating share information. + Support adding a VOL to list. * Uncomment some stuff in process_share() that is/was supposed to possibly fix the 'shareicsi=on' auto sharing but didn't.

"logging_config: Print UTC time on timestamps for logs This is part of a solution for issue #113. Due to the fact we work usually on a higly distributed environment, displaying the messages using UTC is the best way to help people to debug issues. Consulting the logging module documentation: http://docs.python.org/library/logging.html#formatter-objects The way to make the timestamps to display UTC is to change the converter function of the Formatter objects to time.gmtime. So, create a specialized version of the Formatter object, and set it for the logs stored on disk. Console log formatting remains unchanged.

"[reltool] Fix problems with sorting of applications OTP-9792 The following problems have been solved: * reltool_target:do_merge_apps - in recursive calls to this function, the accumulator was reverted each time causing the order of applications listed after kernel and stdlib in the rel specification in the configuration to sometimes be messed up. * There are several ways to specify wich applications to include in an application: 1) in the .app file for the including applications 2a) in the .rel file, when listing applications 2b) in the rel specification in the reltool configuration 2a (systools) and 2b (reltool) should have the same effect and overwrite 1. According to the documentation of systools (sasl), the default value in 2a is an empty list. This should mean that if included applications are not mentioned in the .rel file, then any included application listed in the .app file will be disregarded. This is NOT the way systools actually works. The implementation sets the default for the .rel file to the same list as in the .app file. Reltool earlier implemented 2b as described in the systools documentation. However, after some discussion we decided to change this so that reltool handles 2b in the same way as systools handles 2a since this seems more intuitive. The sasl documentation will be altered accordingly (internal ref OTP-9980). * If the rel specification in the reltool configuration explicitly specified included applications to be an empty list, and the .app file had a non-empty list, then the empty list from the rel specification was discarded. This has been corrected so the rel specification now, if set, always overwrites the value of included_applications in the .app file. * reltool would earlier add load instructions in the script/boot files for ALL modules in the ebin directory of an application even if mod_cond was set to app (include only modules listed in the .app file). This has been corrected - now only modules with #mod.is_included==true are loaded. * reltool would earlier add start instructions in the script/boot file for included applications. This has been corrected - included applications shall only be loaded since the including application is responsible for starting them.",Erlang

"[reltool] Fix problems with sorting of applications OTP-9792 The following problems have been solved: * reltool_target:do_merge_apps - in recursive calls to this function, the accumulator was reverted each time causing the order of applications listed after kernel and stdlib in the rel specification in the configuration to sometimes be messed up. * There are several ways to specify wich applications to include in an application: 1) in the .app file for the including applications 2a) in the .rel file, when listing applications 2b) in the rel specification in the reltool configuration 2a (systools) and 2b (reltool) should have the same effect and overwrite 1. According to the documentation of systools (sasl), the default value in 2a is an empty list. This should mean that if included applications are not mentioned in the .rel file, then any included application listed in the .app file will be disregarded. This is NOT the way systools actually works. The implementation sets the default for the .rel file to the same list as in the .app file. Reltool earlier implemented 2b as described in the systools documentation. However, after some discussion we decided to change this so that reltool handles 2b in the same way as systools handles 2a since this seems more intuitive. The sasl documentation will be altered accordingly (internal ref OTP-9980). * If the rel specification in the reltool configuration explicitly specified included applications to be an empty list, and the .app file had a non-empty list, then the empty list from the rel specification was discarded. This has been corrected so the rel specification now, if set, always overwrites the value of included_applications in the .app file. * reltool would earlier add load instructions in the script/boot files for ALL modules in the ebin directory of an application even if mod_cond was set to app (include only modules listed in the .app file). This has been corrected - now only modules with #mod.is_included==true are loaded. * reltool would earlier add start instructions in the script/boot file for included applications. This has been corrected - included applications shall only be loaded since the including application is responsible for starting them.",Erlang

"Tasks can now have callbacks and errbacks, and dependencies are recorded - The task message format have been updated with two new extension keys Both keys can be empty/undefined or a list of subtasks. - ``callbacks`` Applied if the task exits successfully, with the result of the task as an argument. - ``errbacks`` Applied if an error occurred while executing the task, with the uuid of the task as an argument. Since it may not be possible to serialize the exception instance, it passes the uuid of the task instead. The uuid can then be used to retrieve the exception and traceback of the task from the result backend. - ``link`` and ``link_error`` keyword arguments has been added to ``apply_async``. The value passed can be either a subtask or a list of subtasks: .. code-block:: python add.apply_async((2, 2), link=mul.subtask()) add.apply_async((2, 2), link=[mul.subtask(), echo.subtask()]) Example error callback: .. code-block:: python @task def error_handler(uuid): result = AsyncResult(uuid) exc = result.get(propagate=False) print(""Task %r raised exception: %r\n%r"" % ( exc, result.traceback)) >>> add.apply_async((2, 2), link_error=error_handler) - We now track what subtasks a task sends, and some result backends supports retrieving this information. - task.request.children Contains the result instances of the subtasks the currently executing task has applied. - AsyncResult.children Returns the tasks dependencies, as a list of ``AsyncResult``/``ResultSet`` instances. - AsyncResult.iterdeps Recursively iterates over the tasks dependencies, yielding `(parent, node)` tuples. Raises IncompleteStream if any of the dependencies has not returned yet. - AsyncResult.graph A ``DependencyGraph`` of the tasks dependencies. This can also be used to convert to dot format: .. code-block:: python with open(""graph.dot"") as fh: result.graph.to_dot(fh) which can than be used to produce an image:: $ dot -Tpng graph.dot -o graph.png",Python

"Adding getMetadata method in goog.fs.Entry to match W3C File API. The W3C File API specifies a getMetadata method (see http://www.w3.org/TR/file-system-api/#widl-Entry-getMetadata) on Entry. On the other hand goog.fs.Entry does not provide this method. At the same time goog.fs.Entry provides a getLastModified() which dives in the Metadata object (http://www.w3.org/TR/file-system-api/#idl-def-Metadata) and returns a specific field. This is unnecessarily restricting because it assumes that last modified date is the only field in Metadata, which is not true for Webkit and therefore for Chrome (there is also a ""size"" field in Metadata, even though it is not in the spec yet).

"Module names and constant/inductive names are now in two separate namespaces We now accept the following code: Definition E := 0. Module E. End E. Techically, we simply allow the same label to occur at most twice in a structure_body, which is a (label * structure_field_body) list). These two label occurences should not be at the same level of fields (e.g. a SFBmodule and a SFBmind are ok, but not two SFBmodule's or a SFBmodule and a SFBmodtype). Gain : a minimal amount of code change. Drawback : no more simple List.assoc or equivalent should be performed on a structure_body ... git-svn-id: svn+ssh://scm.gforge.inria.fr/svn/coq/trunk@15088 85f007b7-540e-0410-9357-904b9bb8a0f7",OCaml

"Replace a couple naked `ruby` calls with `CommandTRuby` wrapper calls In the time between when Rainux prepared the pull request that added the lazy-loading feature (commit f175842) and when it got merged, a couple of new finders were added to Command-T. This commit updates them to use the new `CommandTRuby` wrapper function rather than just calling the built-in `ruby` function. Note that this isn't just about consistency but also correctness, as bypassing the wrapper could lead to the `$controller` global variable being nil if the jump or tag finders are the first Command-T function called in a session.

"builtin/show: do not prune by pathspec By design, ""git show commit -- path"" is not ""git show commit:path"", and there is no reason to change that. But ""git show commit -- path"" simply returns nothing at all ""most of the time"" because it prunes by pathspec even though it does not walk commits. This is pretty useless. So, turn off commit pruning (but keep diff limiting of course) so that ""git show commit -- path"" shows the commit message and the diff that the commit introduces to path (filtered by path); only the diff will be empty ""most of the time"". As an intended side effect, users mistaking ""git show commit -- path"" for ""git show commit:path"" are automatically reminded that they asked git to show a commit, not a blob. In case the user has specified ""--do-walk"", assume they want the old behaviour (prune by default). Signed-off-by: Michael J Gruber <git@drmicha.warpmail.net>",C

"persistence: Replace Hibernate with OpenJPA Hibernate is known to be difficult to use in an OSGi context, partly because it isn't packaged as a bundle and thus requires repackaging. This patch replaces Hibernate with OpenJPA in OpenNaaS. OpenJPA is available as a bundle and thus doesn't require repackaging. Several OpenNaaS classes made explicit use of the Hibernate API. This patch changes those classes to use the JPA API when possible. In one case the OpenJPA API needs to be used directly: OpenNaaS's DAO interface makes use of query by example and this functionality is not available in JPA 2. Access to the JDBC driver is always challenging in an OSGi context. Previously we added a dynamic-import to our repackaged Hibernate bundle. This allowed it to load the JDBC driver. The Aries JPA recommended approach is however to configure the persistence.xml file to lookup a data source through JNDI. Using this mechanism, the JDBC driver is loaded by our opennaas-core-resources bundle, which publishes the data source as an OSGi service. Thus no dynamic import is required. This also has the benefit that it becomes easier to inject configuration values when setting up the data source (should we wish to do so in the future).",Java

"Load core packages when connecting to a DB. This is the first step of making it easier to load third-party packages as well as creating settings without having to do so after calling Zen.start and manually migrating the settings (which would also mean you can't use custom assets). Whenever a database connection is created the various model related settings (such as the plugins to use globally) as well as the core packages are loaded. To make this possible the various translation strings for Sequel are ""lazy loaded"" using lambdas. What this means is that instead of the following: require 'zen' require __DIR__('config/database') Zen.start require 'your/custom/package' You can now do this: require 'zen' require __DIR__('config/database') require 'your/custom/package' Zen.start Currently you'd still have to manually migrate settings (if you register any custom ones) since there's no guaranteed order for events to be executed in. I'll address this issue in the following commits. Signed-off-by: Yorick Peterse <yorickpeterse@gmail.com>",Ruby
